<p>&quot;Bridgeport! Change cars for the
Naugatuck Railroad!&quot; shouted the
conductor of the New York and Boston Express
Train, on the evening of May 27, 1858.... Mr.
Johnson, carpet-bag in hand, jumped
upon the platform, entered the office, purchased
a ticket for Waterbury, and was soon whirling
in the Naugatuck train towards his destination.</p>

<p>On reaching Waterbury, in the soft spring
twilight, Mr. Johnson walked up and down in
front of the station, curiously scanning the
faces of the assembled crowd. Presently he
noticed a gentleman who was performing the
same operation upon the faces of the alighting
passengers. Throwing himself directly in the
way of the latter, the two exchanged a steady
gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;Is your name Billings?&quot; &quot;Is your name
Johnson?&quot; were simultaneous questions, followed
by the simultaneous exclamations,&mdash;&quot;Ned!&quot;
&quot;Enos!&quot;</p>

<p>Then there was a crushing grasp of hands,
repeated after a pause, in testimony of ancient
friendship, and Mr. Billings, returning to practical
life asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Is that all your baggage? Come, I have
a buggy here: Eunice has heard the whistle,
and she'll be impatient to welcome you.&quot;</p>

<p>The impatience of Eunice (Mrs. Billings, of
course) was not of long duration; for in five
minutes thereafter she stood at the door of her
husband's chocolate-colored villa, receiving his
friend....</p>

<p>J. Edward Johnson was a tall, thin gentleman
of forty-five.... A year before, some
letters, signed &quot;Foster, Kirkup, &amp; Co., per
Enos Billings,&quot; had accidentally revealed to him
the whereabouts of the old friend of his youth
with whom we now find him domiciled....</p>

<p>&quot;Enos,&quot; said he, as he stretched out his hand
for the third cup of tea (which he had taken
only for the purpose of prolonging the pleasant
table-chat), &quot;I wonder which of us is most
changed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You, of course,&quot; said Mr. Billings, &quot;with
your brown face and big moustache. Your
own brother wouldn't have known you, if he
had seen you last, as I did, with smooth cheeks
and hair of unmerciful length. Why, not even
your voice is the same!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is easily accounted for,&quot; replied Mr.
Johnson. &quot;But in your case, Enos, I am puzzled
to find where the difference lies. Your features
seem to be but little changed, now that I
can examine them at leisure; yet it is not the
same face. But really, I never looked at you
for so long a time, in those days. I beg pardon;
you used to be so&mdash;so remarkably shy.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Billings blushed slightly, and seemed at
a loss what to answer. His wife, however,
burst into a merry laugh, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that was before the days of the A.C.!&quot;</p>

<p>He, catching the infection, laughed also; in
fact, Mr. Johnson laughed, but without knowing
why.</p>

<p>&quot;The 'A.C.'!&quot; said Mr. Billings. &quot;Bless
me, Eunice! how long it is since we have
talked of that summer! I had almost forgotten
that there ever was an A.C....
Well, the A.C. culminated in '45. You remember
something of the society of Norridgeport,
the last winter you were there? Abel
Mallory, for instance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me think a moment,&quot; said Mr. Johnson,
reflectively. &quot;Really, it seems like looking
back a hundred years. Mallory,&mdash;wasn't that
the sentimental young man, with wispy hair, a
tallowy skin, and big, sweaty hands, who used
to be spouting Carlyle on the 'reading evenings'
at Shelldrake's? Yes, to be sure; and there
was Hollins, with his clerical face and infidel
talk,&mdash;and Pauline Ringtop, who used to say,
'The Beautiful is the Good.' I can still hear
her shrill voice singing, 'Would that <i>I</i> were
beautiful, would that <i>I</i> were fair!'&quot;</p>

<p>There was a hearty chorus of laughter at
poor Miss Ringtop's expense. It harmed no
one, however; for the tar-weed was already
thick over her Californian grave.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said Mr. Billings, &quot;you still remember
the absurdities of those days. In fact,
I think you partially saw through them then.
But I was younger, and far from being so clearheaded,
and I looked upon those evenings at
Shelldrake's as being equal, at least, to the
<i>symposia</i> of Plato. Something in Mallory always
repelled me. I detested the sight of his
thick nose, with the flaring nostrils, and his
coarse, half-formed lips, of the bluish color of
raw corned-beef. But I looked upon these
feelings as unreasonable prejudices, and strove
to conquer them, seeing the admiration which
he received from others. He was an oracle on
the subject of 'Nature.' Having eaten nothing
for two years, except Graham bread, vegetables
without salt, and fruits, fresh or dried, he considered
himself to have attained an antediluvian
purity of health,&mdash;or that he would
attain it, so soon as two pimples on his left
temple should have healed. These pimples he
looked upon as the last feeble stand made by
the pernicious juices left from the meat he had
formerly eaten and the coffee he had drunk.
His theory was, that through a body so purged
and purified none but true and natural impulses
could find access to the soul. Such, indeed,
was the theory we all held....</p>

<p>&quot;Shelldrake was a man of more pretence than
real cultivation, as I afterwards discovered.
He was in good circumstances, and always glad
to receive us at his house, as this made him
virtually the chief of our tribe, and the outlay
for refreshments involved only the apples from
his own orchard, and water from his well....</p>

<p>&quot;Well, 't was in the early part of '45,&mdash;I
think in April,&mdash;when we were all gathered together,
discussing, as usual, the possibility of
leading a life in accordance with Nature. Abel
Mallory was there, and Hollins, and Miss
Ringtop, and Faith Levis, with her knitting,&mdash;and
also Eunice Hazleton, a lady whom you
have never seen, but you may take my wife as
her representative....</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I could recollect some of the
speeches made on that occasion. Abel had
but one pimple on his temple (there was a
purple spot where the other had been), and
was estimating that in two or three months
more he would be a true, unspoiled man. His
complexion, nevertheless, was more clammy
and whey-like than ever.</p>

<p>&quot;'Yes,' said he, 'I also am an Arcadian! This
false dual existence which I have been leading
will soon be merged in the unity of Nature. Our
lives must conform to her sacred law. Why
can't we strip off these hollow Shams,' (he
made great use of that word,) 'and be our true
selves, pure, perfect, and divine?' ...</p>

<p>&quot;Shelldrake, however, turning to his wife,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'Elviry, how many up-stairs rooms is there
in that house down on the Sound?'</p>

<p>&quot;'Four,&mdash;besides three small ones under the
roof. Why, what made you think of that,
Jesse?' said she.</p>

<p>&quot;'I've got an idea, while Abel's been talking,'
he answered. 'We've taken a house for
the summer, down the other side of Bridgeport,
right on the water, where there's good fishing
and a fine view of the Sound. Now, there's
room enough for all of us,&mdash;at least, all that
can make it suit to go. Abel, you and Enos,
and Pauline and Eunice might fix matters so
that we could all take the place in partnership,
and pass the summer together, living a true
and beautiful life in the bosom of Nature.
There we shall be perfectly free and untrammelled
by the chains which still hang around
us in Norridgeport. You know how often we
have wanted to be set on some island in the
Pacific Ocean, where we could build up a true
society, right from the start. Now, here's a
chance to try the experiment for a few months,
anyhow.'</p>

<p>&quot;Eunice clapped her hands (yes, you did!)
and cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'Splendid! Arcadian! I'll give up my
school for the summer.' ...</p>

<p>&quot;Abel Mallory, of course, did not need to
have the proposal repeated. He was ready
for any thing which promised indolence, and
the indulgence of his sentimental tastes. I will
do the fellow the justice to say that he was not
a hypocrite. He firmly believed both in himself
and his ideas,&mdash;especially the former. He
pushed both hands through the long wisps of
his drab-colored hair, and threw his head back
until his wide nostrils resembled a double door
to his brain.</p>

<p>&quot;'O Nature!' he said, 'you have found your
lost children! We shall obey your neglected
laws! we shall hearken to your divine whispers!
we shall bring you back from your ignominious
exile, and place you on your ancestral
throne!' ...</p>

<p>&quot;The company was finally arranged to consist
of the Shelldrakes, Hollins, Mallory, Eunice,
Miss Ringtop, and myself. We did not
give much thought, either to the preparations
in advance, or to our mode of life when settled
there. We were to live near to Nature: that
was the main thing.</p>

<p>&quot;'What shall we call the place?&quot; asked
Eunice.</p>

<p>&quot;'Arcadia!' said Abel Mallory, rolling up
his large green eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;'Then,' said Hollins, 'let us constitute ourselves
the Arcadian Club!'&quot;</p>

<p>&mdash;&quot;Aha!&quot; interrupted Mr. Johnson, &quot;I
see! The A.C.!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you see the A.C. now, but to
understand it fully, you should have had
a share in those Arcadian experiences....
It was a lovely afternoon in June when
we first approached Arcadia.... Perkins
Brown, Shelldrake's boy-of-all-work, awaited
us at the door. He had been sent on
two or three days in advance, to take charge
of the house, and seemed to have had enough
of hermit-life, for he hailed us with a wild
whoop, throwing his straw hat half-way up
one of the poplars. Perkins was a boy of fifteen,
the child of poor parents, who were satisfied
to get him off their hands, regardless as to
what humanitarian theories might be tested
upon him. As the Arcadian Club recognized
no such thing as caste, he was always admitted
to our meetings, and understood just enough
of our conversation to excite a silly ambition in
his slow mind....</p>

<p>&quot;Our board, that evening, was really tempting.
The absence of meat was compensated to
us by the crisp and racy onions, and I craved
only a little salt, which had been interdicted, as
a most pernicious substance. I sat at one corner
of the table, beside Perkins Brown, who
took an opportunity, while the others were engaged
in conversation, to jog my elbow gently.
As I turned towards him, he said nothing, but
dropped his eyes significantly. The little rascal
had the lid of a blacking-box, filled with salt,
upon his knee, and was privately seasoning his
onions and radishes. I blushed at the thought
of my hypocrisy, but the onions were so much
better that I couldn't help dipping into the
lid with him.</p>

<p>&quot;'Oh,' said Eunice, 'we must send for some
oil and vinegar! This lettuce is very nice.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Oil and vinegar?' exclaimed Abel.</p>

<p>&quot;'Why, yes,' said she, innocently: 'they are
both vegetable substances.'</p>

<p>&quot;Abel at first looked rather foolish, but
quickly recovering herself, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'All vegetable substances are not proper
for food: you would not taste the poison-oak,
or sit under the upas-tree of Java.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Well, Abel,' Eunice rejoined, 'how are we
to distinguish what is best for us? How are
we to know <i>what</i> vegetables to choose, or what
animal and mineral substances to avoid?'</p>

<p>&quot;'I will tell you,' he answered, with a lofty
air. 'See here!' pointing to his temple, where
the second pimple&mdash;either from the change of
air, or because, in the excitement of the last
few days, he had forgotten it&mdash;was actually
healed. 'My blood is at last pure. The struggle
between the natural and the unnatural is over,
and I am beyond the depraved influences of my
former taste. My instincts are now, therefore,
entirely pure also. What is good for man to
eat, that I shall have a natural desire to eat:
what is bad will be naturally repelled. How
does the cow distinguish between the wholesome
and the poisonous herbs of the meadow?
And is man less than a cow, that he cannot cultivate
his instincts to an equal point? Let me
walk through the woods and I can tell you every
berry and root which God designed for food,
though I know not its name, and have never
seen it before. I shall make use of my time,
during our sojourn here, to test, by my purified
instinct, every substance, animal, mineral, and
vegetable, upon which the human race subsists,
and to create a catalogue of the True Food of
Man!' ...</p>

<p>&quot;Our lazy life during the hot weather had
become a little monotonous. The Arcadian
plan had worked tolerably well, on the whole,
for there was very little for any one to do,&mdash;Mrs.
Shelldrake and Perkins Brown excepted.
Our conversation, however, lacked spirit and
variety. We were, perhaps unconsciously, a
little tired of hearing and assenting to the same
sentiments. But, one evening, about this time,
Hollins struck upon a variation, the consequences
of which he little foresaw. We had been
reading one of Bulwer's works, (the weather
was too hot for Psychology,) and came upon
this paragraph, or something like it:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'Ah, Behind the Veil! We see the summer
smile of the Earth,&mdash;enamelled meadow
and limpid stream,&mdash;but what hides she in her
sunless heart? Caverns of serpents, or grottoes
of priceless gems? Youth, whose soul sits on
thy countenance, thyself wearing no mask, strive
not to lift the masks of others! Be content
with what thou seest; and wait until Time and
Experience shall teach thee to find jealousy
behind the sweet smile, and hatred under the
honeyed word!'</p>

<p>&quot;This seemed to us a dark and bitter reflection
but one or another of us recalled some
illustration of human hypocrisy, and the
evidences, by the simple fact of repetition,
gradually led to a division of opinion,&mdash;Rollins,
Shelldrake, and Miss Ringtop on the dark side,
and the rest of us on the bright. The last,
however, contented herself with quoting from
her favorite poet Gamaliel J. Gawthrop:&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;'I look beyond thy brow's concealment!<br />
I see thy spirit's dark revealment!<br />
Thy inner self betrayed I see:<br />
Thy coward, craven, shivering ME!'<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;'We think we know one another,' exclaimed
Rollins; 'but do we? We see the faults of
others, their weaknesses, their disagreeable
qualities, and we keep silent. How much we
should gain, were candor as universal as concealment
Then each one, seeing himself as
others see him, would truly know himself.
How much misunderstanding might be avoided,
how much hidden shame be removed,
hopeless because unspoken love made glad,
honest admiration cheer its object, uttered
sympathy mitigate misfortune,&mdash;in short, how
much brighter and happier the world would
become, if each one expressed, everywhere and
at all times, his true and entire feeling! Why,
even Evil would lose half its power!'</p>

<p>&quot;There seemed to be so much practical wisdom
in these views that we were all dazzled and
half-convinced at the start. So, when Hollins,
turning towards me, as he continued, exclaimed,&mdash;'Come,
why should not this candor be adopted
in our Arcadia? Will any one&mdash;will you,
Enos&mdash;commence at once by telling me now&mdash;to
my face&mdash;my principal faults?' I answered,
after a moment's reflection,&mdash;'You have a great
deal of intellectual arrogance, and you are,
physically, very indolent.'</p>

<p>&quot;He did not flinch from the self-invited test,
though he looked a little surprised.</p>

<p>&quot;'Well put,' said he, 'though I do not say
that you are entirely correct. Now, what are
my merits?'</p>

<p>&quot;'You are clear-sighted,' I answered, 'an
earnest seeker after truth, and courageous in
the avowal of your thoughts.'</p>

<p>&quot;This restored the balance, and we soon began
to confess our own private faults and weaknesses.
Though the confessions did not go
very deep,&mdash;no one betraying any thing we did
not all know already,&mdash;yet they were sufficient
to strengthen Hollins in his new idea, and it
was unanimously resolved that Candor should
thenceforth be the main charm of our Arcadian
life....</p>

<p>&quot;The next day, Abel, who had resumed his
researches after the True Food, came home to
supper with a healthier color than I had before
seen on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;'Do you know,' said he, looking shyly at
Hollins, 'that I begin to think Beer must
be a natural beverage? There was an auction
in the village to-day, as I passed through, and
I stopped at a cake-stand to get a glass of water,
as it was very hot. There was no water,&mdash;only
beer: so I thought I would try a glass, simply
as an experiment. Really, the flavor was very
agreeable. And it occurred to me, on the way
home, that all the elements contained in beer
are vegetable. Besides, fermentation is a
natural process. I think the question has never
been properly tested before.'</p>

<p>&quot;'But the alcohol!' exclaimed Hollins.</p>

<p>&quot;'I could not distinguish any, either by taste
or smell. I know that chemical analysis is said
to show it; but may not the alcohol be created,
somehow, during the analysis?'</p>

<p>&quot;'Abel,' said Hollins, in a fresh burst of candor,
'you will never be a Reformer, until you
possess some of the commonest elements of
knowledge.'</p>

<p>&quot;The rest of us were much diverted: it was
a pleasant relief to our monotonous amiability.</p>

<p>&quot;Abel, however, had a stubborn streak in his
character. The next day he sent Perkins
Brown to Bridgeport for a dozen bottles of
'Beer.' Perkins, either intentionally or by mistake,
(I always suspected the former,) brought
pint-bottles of Scotch ale, which he placed in the
coolest part of the cellar. The evening happened
to be exceedingly hot and sultry; and, as we
were all fanning ourselves and talking languidly,
Abel bethought him of his beer. In his thirst,
he drank the contents of the first bottle, almost
at a single draught.</p>

<p>&quot;'The effect of beer,' said he, 'depends, I
think, on the commixture of the nourishing
principle of the grain with the cooling properties
of the water. Perhaps, hereafter, a liquid
food of the same character may be invented,
which shall save us from mastication and all the
diseases of the teeth.'</p>

<p>&quot;Hollins and Shelldrake, at his invitation,
divided a bottle between them, and he took a
second. The potent beverage was not long in
acting on a brain so unaccustomed to its influence.
He grew unusually talkative and
sentimental, in a few minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;'Oh, sing, somebody!' he sighed in hoarse
rapture: 'the night was made for Song.'</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Ringtop, nothing loath, immediately
commenced, 'When stars are in the quiet skies';
but scarcely had she finished the first verse
before Abel interrupted her.</p>

<p>&quot;'Candor's the order of the day, isn't it?'
he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;'Yes!' 'Yes!' two or three answered.</p>

<p>&quot;'Well, then,' said he, 'candidly, Pauline,
you've got the darn'dest squeaky voice'&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Ringtop gave a faint little scream of
horror.</p>

<p>&quot;'Oh, never mind!' he continued. 'We act
according to impulse, don't we? And I've
the impulse to swear; and it's right. Let Nature
have her way. Listen! Damn, damn,
damn, damn! I never knew it was so easy.
Why, there's a pleasure in it! Try it, Pauline!
try it on me!'</p>

<p>&quot;'Oh-ooh!' was all Miss Ringtop could
utter.</p>

<p>&quot;'Abel! Abel!' exclaimed Hollins, 'the
beer has got into your head.'</p>

<p>&quot;'No, it isn't Beer,&mdash;it's Candor!' said
Abel. 'It's your own proposal, Hollins.
Suppose it's evil to swear: isn't it better I
should express it, and be done with it, than
keep it bottled up, to ferment in my mind?
Oh, you're a precious, consistent old humbug,
<i>you</i> are!'</p>

<p>&quot;And therewith he jumped off the stoop,
and went dancing awkwardly down towards the
water, singing in a most unmelodious voice,
''Tis home where'er the heart is.' ...</p>

<p>&quot;We had an unusually silent breakfast the
next morning. Abel scarcely spoke, which the
others attributed to a natural feeling of shame,
after his display of the previous evening. Hollins
and Shelldrake discussed Temperance, with
a special view to his edification, and Miss Ringtop
favored us with several quotations about
'the maddening bowl,'&mdash;but he paid no attention
to them....</p>

<p>&quot;The forenoon was overcast, with frequent
showers. Each one occupied his or her room
until dinner-time, when we met again with
something of the old geniality. There was an
evident effort to restore our former flow of
good feeling. Abel's experience with the beer
was freely discussed. He insisted strongly
that he had not been laboring under its effects,
and proposed a mutual test. He, Shelldrake,
and Hollins were to drink it in equal measures,
and compare observations as to their physical
sensations. The others agreed,&mdash;quite willingly,
I thought,&mdash;but I refused....</p>

<p>&quot;There was a sound of loud voices, as we
approached the stoop. Hollins, Shelldrake
and his wife, and Abel Mallory were sitting together
near the door. Perkins Brown, as usual,
was crouched on the lowest step, with one leg
over the other, and rubbing the top of his boot
with a vigor which betrayed to me some secret
mirth. He looked up at me from under his straw
hat with the grin of a malicious Puck, glanced
towards the group, and made a curious gesture
with his thumb. There were several empty
pint bottles on the stoop.</p>

<p>&quot;'Now, are you sure you can bear the test?'
we heard Hollins ask, as we approached.</p>

<p>&quot;'Bear it? Why, to be sure!' replied Shelldrake
'if I couldn't bear it, or if <i>you</i> couldn't,
your theory's done for. Try! I can stand it
as long as you can.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Well, then,' said Hollins, 'I think you are
a very ordinary man. I derive no intellectual
benefit from my intercourse with you, but your
house is convenient to me. I'm under no
obligations for your hospitality, however, because
my company is an advantage to you.
Indeed, if I were treated according to my deserts,
you couldn't do enough for me.'</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Shelldrake was up in arms.</p>

<p>&quot;'Indeed,' she exclaimed, 'I think you get
as good as you deserve, and more too.'</p>

<p>&quot;Elvira,' said he, with a benevolent condescension,
'I have no doubt you think so, for
your mind belongs to the lowest and most material
sphere. You have your place in Nature,
and you fill it; but it is not for you to judge of
intelligences which move only on the upper
planes.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Hollins,' said Shelldrake, 'Elviry's a good
wife and a sensible woman, and I won't allow
you to turn up your nose at her.'</p>

<p>&quot;'I am not surprised,' he answered, 'that
you should fail to stand the test. I didn't
expect it.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Let me try it on <i>you</i>!' cried Shelldrake.
'You, now, have some intellect,&mdash;I don't deny
that,&mdash;but not so much, by a long shot, as you
think you have. Besides that, you're awfully
selfish in your opinions. You won't admit that
anybody can be right who differs from you.
You've sponged on me for a long time; but
I suppose I've learned something from you, so
we'll call it even. I think, however, that what
you call acting according to impulse is simply
an excuse to cover your own laziness.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Gosh! that's it!' interrupted Perkins,
jumping up; then, recollecting himself, he
sank down on the steps again, and shook
with a suppressed 'Ho! ho! ho!'</p>

<p>&quot;Hollins, however, drew himself up with an
exasperated air.</p>

<p>&quot;'Shelldrake,' said he, 'I pity you. I always
knew your ignorance, but I thought you honest
in your human character. I never suspected
you of envy and malice. However, the true Reformer
must expect to be misunderstood and
misrepresented by meaner minds. That love
which I bear to all creatures teaches me to forgive
you. Without such love, all plans of progress
must fail. Is it not so, Abel?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shelldrake could only ejaculate the words,
'Pity!' 'Forgive!' in his most contemptuous
tone; while Mrs. Shelldrake, rocking violently
in her chair, gave utterance to that peculiar
clucking '<i>ts, ts, ts, ts</i>,' whereby certain women
express emotions too deep for words.</p>

<p>&quot;Abel, roused by Hollins' question, answered,
with a sudden energy,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Love! there is no love in the world. Where
will you find it? Tell me, and I'll go there.
Love! I'd like to see it! If all human hearts
were like mine, we might have an Arcadia; but
most men have no hearts. The world is a miserable,
hollow, deceitful shell of vanity and hypocrisy.
No: let us give up. We were born
before our time: this age is not worthy of us.'</p>

<p>&quot;Hollins stared at the speaker in utter amazement.
Shelldrake gave a long whistle, and finally
gasped out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'Well, what next?'</p>

<p>&quot;None of us were prepared for such a sudden
and complete wreck of our Arcadian scheme.
The foundations had been sapped before, it is
true; but we had not perceived it; and now,
in two short days, the whole edifice tumbled
about our ears. Though it was inevitable, we
felt a shock of sorrow, and a silence fell upon
us. Only that scamp of a Perkins Brown, chuckling
and rubbing his boot, really rejoiced. I
could have kicked him.</p>

<p>&quot;We all went to bed, feeling that the charm
of our Arcadian life was over.... In the
first revulsion of feeling, I was perhaps unjust
to my associates. I see now, more clearly, the
causes of those vagaries, which originated in a
genuine aspiration, and failed from an ignorance
of the true nature of Man, quite as much as
from the egotism of the individuals. Other attempts
at reorganizing Society were made about
the same time by men of culture and experience,
but in the A.C. we had neither. Our
leaders had caught a few half-truths, which,
in their minds, were speedly warped into
errors.&quot; ...&mdash;<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, February,

<p>
The days were at their longest,<br />
The heat was at its strongest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Brown, old friend and true,</span><br />
Wrote thus: &quot;Dear Jack, why swelter<br />
In town when shade and shelter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are waiting here for you?</span><br />
Quit Bulls and Bears and gambling,<br />
For rural sports and rambling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forsake your Wall Street tricks;</span><br />
Come without hesitation,<br />
Check to Dobbs' Ferry Station,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We dine at half-past six.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
I went,&mdash;a welcome hearty,<br />
A merry country party,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A drive, and then croquet,</span><br />
A quiet, well-cooked dinner,<br />
Three times at billiards winner,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The evening sped away;</span><br />
When Brown, the dear old joker,<br />
Cried, &quot;Come, my worthy broker,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hour is growing late;</span><br />
Your room is cool and quiet,<br />
As for the bed, just try it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breakfast at half-past eight.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
I took Brown's hand, applauded<br />
His generous care, and lauded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dobbs' Ferry to the skies.</span><br />
A shade came o'er his features,<br />
&quot;We should be happy creatures,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And this a paradise,</span><br />
But, ah! the deep disgrace is,<br />
This loveliest of places<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A vulgar name should blight!</span><br />
But, death to Dobbs! we'll change it,<br />
If money can arrange it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So, pleasant dreams; good night!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
I could not sleep, but, raising<br />
The window, stood, moon-gazing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In fairyland a guest;</span><br />
&quot;On such a night,&quot; <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;<br />
See Shakespeare for much better a<br />
Description of the rest,&mdash;<br />
I mused, how sweet to wander<br />
Beside the river, yonder;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then the sudden whim</span><br />
Seized my head to pillow<br />
On Hudson's sparkling billow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A midnight, moonlight swim!</span><br />
<br />
Soon thought and soon attempted;<br />
At once my room was emptied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of its sole occupant;</span><br />
The roof was low, and easily,<br />
In fact, quite Japanese-ily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I took the downward slant,</span><br />
Then, without stay or stopping,<br />
My first and last eaves-dropping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By leader-pipe I sped,</span><br />
And through the thicket gliding,<br />
Down the steep hillside sliding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon reached the river's bed.</span><br />
<br />
But what was my amazement,&mdash;<br />
The fair scene from the casement,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How changed! I could not guess</span><br />
Where track or rails had vanished,<br />
Town, villas, station, banished,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All was a wilderness.</span><br />
Only one ancient gable,<br />
A low-roofed inn and stable,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A creaking sign displayed,</span><br />
An antiquated wherry,<br />
Below it&mdash;&quot;DOBBS HIS FERRY&quot;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the clear moonlight swayed.</span><br />
<br />
I turned, and there the craft was,<br />
Its shape 'twixt scow and raft was,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Square ends, low sides, and flat,</span><br />
And standing close beside me,<br />
An ancient chap who eyed me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath a steeple-hat;</span><br />
Short legs&mdash;long pipe&mdash;style very<br />
Pre-Revolutionary,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I bow, he grimly bobs,</span><br />
Then, with some perturbation,<br />
By way of salutation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says I, &quot;How are you, Dobbs!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
He grum and silent beckoned,<br />
And I, in half a second,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scarce knowing what I did,</span><br />
Took the stern seat, Dobbs throwing<br />
Himself 'midships, and rowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swift through the stream we slid;</span><br />
He pulled awhile, then stopping,<br />
And both oars slowly dropping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His pipe aside he laid,</span><br />
Drew a long breath, and taking<br />
An attitude, and shaking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His fist towards shore, thus said:&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Of all sharp cuts the keenest,<br />
Of all mean turns the meanest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vilest of all vile jobs,</span><br />
Worse than the Cow-Boy pillagers,<br />
Are these Dobbs' Ferry villagers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A going back on Dobbs!</span><br />
'Twould not be more anom'lous<br />
If Rome went back on Rom'lus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Old rum-un like myself),</span><br />
Or Hail Columbia, played out<br />
By Southern Dixie, laid out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Columbus on the shelf!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;They say 'Dobbs' ain't melodious,<br />
It's 'horrid,' 'vulgar,' 'odious,'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all their crops it sticks;</span><br />
And then the worse addendum<br />
Of 'Ferry' does offend 'em<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More than its vile prefix.</span><br />
Well, it does seem distressing,<br />
But, if I'm good at guessing,<br />
Each one of these same nobs,<br />
If there was money in it,<br />
Would ferry in a minute,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And change his name to Dobbs!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;That's it, they're not partic'lar,<br />
Respecting the auric'lar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At a stiff market rate;</span><br />
But Dobbs' especial vice is,<br />
That he keeps down the prices<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all their real estate!</span><br />
A name so unattractive<br />
Keeps villa-sites inactive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spoils the broker's jobs;</span><br />
They think that speculation<br />
Would rage at 'Paulding's Station,'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which stagnates now at 'Dobbs.'</span><br />
<br />
&quot;'Paulding's!&quot;&mdash;that's sentimental!<br />
An old Dutch Continental,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bushwhacked up there a spell;</span><br />
But why he should come blustering<br />
Round here, and filibustering,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is more than I can tell;</span><br />
Sat playing for a wager,<br />
And nabbed a British major.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well, if the plans and charts</span><br />
From Andre's boots he hauled out,<br />
Is his name to be bawled out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forever, round these parts?</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Guess not! His pay and bounty<br />
And mon'ment from the county<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Paid him off, every cent,</span><br />
While this snug town and station,<br />
To every generation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall be Dobbs' monument;</span><br />
Spite of all speculators<br />
And ancient-landmark traitors,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who, all along this shore,</span><br />
Are ever substitutin'<br />
The modern, highfalutin',<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the plain names of yore.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Down there, on old Manhattan,<br />
Where land-sharks breed and fatten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They've wiped out Tubby Hook.</span><br />
That famous promontory,<br />
Renowned in song and story,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which time nor tempest shook,</span><br />
Whose name for aye had been good,<br />
Stands newly christened 'Inwood,'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And branded with the shame</span><br />
Of some old rogue who passes<br />
By dint of aliases,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Afraid of his own name!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;See how they quite outrival,<br />
Plain barnyard Spuytenduyvil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By peacock Riverdale,</span><br />
Which thinks all else it conquers,<br />
And over homespun Yonkers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spreads out its flaunting tail!</span><br />
There's new-named Mount St. Vincent,<br />
Where each dear little inn'cent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is taught the Popish rites,&mdash;</span><br />
Well, ain't it queer, wherever<br />
These saints possess the river<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They get the finest sites!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;They've named a place for Irving,<br />
A trifle more deserving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than your French, foreign saints,</span><br />
But if he has such mention,<br />
It's past my comprehension<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why Dobbs should cause complaints;</span><br />
Wrote histories and such things,<br />
About Old Knick and Dutch things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dolph Heyligers and Rips;</span><br />
But no old antiquary<br />
Like him could keep a ferry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all his authorships!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;By aid of these same showmen,<br />
Some fanciful cognomen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Cro'nest stock might bring</span><br />
As high as Butter Hill is,<br />
Which, patronized by Willis,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaves cards now as 'Storm-King!'</span><br />
Can't some poetic swell-beau<br />
Re-christen old Crum Elbow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And each prosaic bluff,</span><br />
Bold Breakneck gently flatter,<br />
And Dunderberg bespatter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With euphony and stuff!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;'T would be a <i>magnum opus</i><br />
To bury old Esopus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Time's sepulchral vaults,</span><br />
Or in Oblivion's deep sea<br />
Submerge renowned Poughkeepsie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And also ancient Paltz;</span><br />
How it would give them rapture<br />
Brave Stony Point to capture,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make it face about;</span><br />
Bid Rhinebeck sound much smoother<br />
Than in the tongue of Luther,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wipe the Catskills out!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Well, DOBBS is DOBBS, and faster<br />
Than pitch or mustard-plaster<br />
Shall it stick hereabouts,<br />
While Tappan Sea rolls yonder,<br />
Or round High Torn the thunder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along these ramparts shouts.</span><br />
No corner-lot banditti,<br />
Or brokers from the City&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like you&mdash;&quot; Here Dobbs began</span><br />
Wildly both oars to brandish,<br />
As fierce as old Miles Standish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or young Phil Sheridan.</span><br />
<br />
Sternwards he rushed,&mdash;I, ducking,<br />
Seized both his legs, and chucking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dobbs sideways, splash he went,&mdash;</span><br />
The wherry swayed, then righted,<br />
While I, somewhat excited,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the water bent;</span><br />
Three times he rose, but vainly<br />
I clutched his form ungainly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sank, while sighs and sobs</span><br />
Beneath the waves seemed muttered,<br />
And all the night-winds uttered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In sad tones, &quot;Dobbs! Dobbs! Dobbs!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
Just then some giant boulders<br />
Upon my head and shoulders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made sudden, fearful raids,</span><br />
And on my face and forehead,<br />
With din and uproar horrid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came several Palisades;</span><br />
I screamed, and woke, in screaming,<br />
To see, by gaslight's gleaming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brown's face above my bed;</span><br />
&quot;Why, Jack, what is the matter?<br />
We heard a dreadful clatter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found you on the shed!</span><br />
<br />
&quot;It's plain enough, supposing<br />
You sat there, moon-struck, dozing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the window's edge,</span><br />
Then lost yourself, and falling,<br />
Just where we found you, sprawling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Struck the piazza ledge;</span><br />
A lucky hit, old fellow,<br />
Of black and blue and yellow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It gives your face a touch,</span><br />
You saved your neck, but barely;<br />
To state the matter fairly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You took a drop too much!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
I took the train next morning,<br />
Some lumps my nose adorning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My forehead, sundry knobs,</span><br />
My ideas slightly wandering,<br />
But, as I went, much pondering<br />
Upon my night with Dobbs;<br />
Brown thinks it, dear old sinner,<br />
A case of &quot;after dinner,&quot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And won't believe a word,</span><br />

<h2><a name="FATHER_HIGGINSS_PREFERMENT" id="FATHER_HIGGINSS_PREFERMENT"></a>FATHER HIGGINS'S PREFERMENT.</h2>


<p>Father Higgins was not the kind of
divine who easily finds preferment in
the Catholic Church, or who would be apt to
make a shining mark in any other.</p>

<p>Fat and red-faced and pudding-headed was
Father Higgins; uncommonly in the way of
good eating, and now and then disposed for
good drinking; as lazy as he dared be, ignorant
enough for a hermit, and simple enough for a
monk. His chief excellence lay in his kindliness
of heart, which would doubtless have
made him very serviceable and comfortable to
his fellow-men, had it not been for his indolence,
his spare intellectual gifts, and perhaps a
little leaven of selfishness.</p>

<p>Such as he was, however, Father Higgins had
no small &quot;consate&quot; of himself, and sometimes
thought that even a bishopric would not be
&quot;beyant his desarts.&quot; He pleased himself with
imagining how finely he would fill an episcopal
chair, what apostolic labors he would accomplish
in his diocese, what swarms of heretics or
pagans he would convert, what a self-sacrificing
and heroic life he would lead, and what a saintly
name he would leave. One day, or to speak
with a precision worthy of this true history, one
evening, he became a bishop.</p>

<p>It happened on this wise. Father Higgins
had ventured to treat himself to a spectacle.
He had attended, for the first time in his life,
an exhibition of legerdemain; this one being
given by that celebrated master of the black-art,
Professor Heller. He had seen the professor
change turnips into gold watches, draw a
dozen live pigeons in succession out of an
empty box, send rings into ladies' handkerchiefs
at the other end of the hall, catch a
bullet out of an exploded pistol in his hand,
and perform other marvels equally irrational
and disturbing. From this raree-show Father
Higgins had gone home feeling that he had witnessed
something about as unearthly as he was
likely to be confronted with in the next world.</p>

<p>For an hour or more he sat in his elbow-chair,
puzzling over the professor's &quot;diviltries,&quot;
and crossing himself at the remembrance of
each one of them. It was black midnight, and
stormy at that; there was such an uproar in
the elm branches over his house as if all the
Salem witches were holding Sabbath there; the
whole village of Sableburg swarmed with windy
rushings and shriekings and slammings. It was
one of those midnights when the devil evidently
&quot;has business on his hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Of a sudden there was a rustle in the room,
and looking around to discover the cause of it,
Father Higgins beheld a tall and dark man with
startling black eyes, in whom he recognized
Professor Heller.</p>

<p>&quot;What's yer will, sir?&quot; demanded the Father,
a good deal astonished, but not a bit frightened.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand, sir, that you would like to be
a bishop,&quot; replied the professor, bowing politely,
but seating himself unceremoniously.</p>

<p>&quot;That's thrue enough, sir,&quot; replied Father
Higgins, who somehow felt curiously at his
ease, and disposed at once to be confidential
with this utter stranger. &quot;I've often imagined
meself a bishop, an' doin' wondhers in me office.
But it's nonsinse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What post would suit you?&quot; inquired the
visitor. &quot;The diocese of New York?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; said the father. &quot;I'm not ayqual
to sich a risponsebility; that is, not at wanst,
ye ondherstand. I'd like best to come up to
sich a place as that gintly an' by degrays.
It's been a drame av mine to begin my prefarmint
as biship av some far-away continent or
archypilago, like, an' convart slathers av haythins
an' cannebals for a practice. It ud plase
me imagenation to prache among corrils an'
coky-nuts an' naked crachurs. Y' are aware, I
suppose, Misther Heller&mdash;or Professor Heller&mdash;av
sich islands as Owyhee an' the Marquesas,
famous a'ready in the history av the Propaganda
Fide. Jist suppose me havin' me episkepal
raysedence on wan av 'um, an' makin' me
progresses to the others. There be great devoshin
to a spiritual father among thim simple
people, I'm thinkin.' I'd be a god to 'um,
like. Sich obeyjince ud jist shuit me. Yes,
I'd enj'y bein' Biship av the Cannebal Islands,
or even av wan av um.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Faith is necessary,&quot; replied Heller. &quot;You
must believe that you are to be Bishop of the
Cannibal Islands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure an' it's not aisy at this distance to belave
in the islands thimselves, let alone bein'
spiritual father av the same,&quot; smiled the priest.
&quot;Howandiver, there's no harrum in tryin' to
belave, an' so here goes for the exparimint. If
ye'll kape silence a bit, I'll jist collect me
moind on the subject, an' we'll see what
happens.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment the gray, piggish eyes of the
Father, and the black, gleaming, mysterious
orbs of his visitor were fixed upon each other.
In the next moment Heller, bowing with a
ceremonious air of respect, inquired, &quot;What
are your commands, my lord bishop?&quot;</p>

<p>Startled by a consciousness of some wonderful
change, doubtful in what land he was, or
even in what age of the world, Father Higgins
stared about him in expectation. A sunny
shore, scattered groves of cocoa-nut trees, distant
villages of circular huts, beyond them far-stretching
forests and a smoking volcano; on
the hither side bays alive with carved and
painted canoes, near at hand a gathering crowd
of half-naked savages&mdash;such were the objects
that filled his vision.</p>

<p>&quot;So this is me diocese,&quot; he said, without
feeling the least surprise. &quot;Well, the climate
is deloightful. Let us hope that the coky-nuts
will agree wid us, an' that the natives won't
urge upon us the blissins av martyrdom. Professor,
what may be the spiritual condition av
things hereaway, do ye think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A clear field&mdash;not a convert yet. Your
predecessor, who went through the office of
being eaten a year ago, had not even learned
the language.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The blissid saints watch over us! To hear
the likes av that, whin I expected to be a god,
like, among these wretches! Well, it's our
duty we must do, Heller; we mustn't run
away from our post; indade, we can't. Moreover,
I feel a sthrong confidence that the howly
Catholic Church is to be greatly glorified by
me on these islands. What do ye say now to
meself exhibitin' the gift av miracles an'
tongues? If I should discoorse to these cannebals
in their own contimptible language,
would it surprise ye, Heller?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; smiled the professor. &quot;I have seen
greater marvels in my time. I have seen men
preach not merely words, but feelings and
faiths, that they were ignorant of.&quot;</p>

<p>Father Higgins, closely followed by Heller,
now advanced to a green hillock, a few rods
from the shelly and pebbly beach, knelt down
upon the thin sward, and repeated a prayer.
Meantime the population gathered; behind
them canoe after canoe touched the shore; before
them there was a swift, tumultuous hurrying
from the villages; presently they were
surrounded by a compact, eager, barbaric multitude.
The babble of its wonder turned to
silence as the priest rose, extended his fat
hands, and commenced a sermon.</p>

<p>Father Higgins was not a bit astonished at
hearing himself pour forth a torrent of words
which he did not understand, nor at seeing in
the faces of his wild listeners that they perfectly
comprehended his discourse. It was
merely a supernatural inspiration; it was but
another exhibition of the heavenly gifts of the
Church; he was as much at his ease as if he
had been in the habit of working miracles from
his cradle. At the close of his harangue he
took out his breviary, and translated a prayer
into the unknown tongue. Evidently the auditors
understood this also, for while some
crouched to earth in undisguisable terror,
others looked upward as if expecting an answer
from the sky.</p>

<p>Presently a savage, in a many-colored robe
of feathers, stepped in front of the multitude,
and uttered a few sentences.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a mighty quare providence that this
miracle works ownly wan way,&quot; observed Father
Higgins to Heller. &quot;It's meself can prache
acceptably to this poor haythin, an' it's meself,
loikewise, can't sense a blissid word he gabbles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is comparing you with your predecessor,&quot;
exclaimed the professor. &quot;He says the
other man called himself a messenger from
God; but as he could not talk Feejee, they
saw that he was a liar, because God knows
every language; and so, having found him a
liar, they fattened him with fish and cocoa-nuts,
and ate him. As for you, they admit that you
are a heavenly personage, and they mean to
worship you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How came ye to larn the language, annyway?&quot;
demanded the priest.</p>

<p>&quot;I have wandered to and fro in the earth a
good deal,&quot; replied Heller. &quot;I have performed
some of my best black-art in these islands.&quot;</p>

<p>Father Higgins, rather bothered by these
statements, was about to ask further questions,
when he was seized by four sturdy natives, who
mounted him upon their naked shoulders, while
four others uplifted the professor in like manner,
all then setting off rapidly toward the village,
followed by the whole crowd in procession.</p>

<p>&quot;An' what if I should tell ye I had conscientious
scruples agenst lettin' meself be
adored for a heavenly personage?&quot; objected
the good Father.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't think of it,&quot; counselled Heller. &quot;Being
worshipped is infinitely more agreeable than
being eaten. Besides, consider the interests of
the Church. If you are set up as a god, you
can use the position to sprinkle holy water on
your adorers, and so convert the whole island
without trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure y' are mighty well varsed in the precepts
and customs av the Jesuit Fathers,&quot; answered
the priest, with a stare of wonder and
admiration. &quot;I moind me now that the missionaries
in Chaynee baptized lashins av haythin
babies under pretinse av rubbin' um with
medicine. An' it's a maxim that whin the ind
is salvatory, the manes are justified. It's a
maxim, also, that y' ave no business to lead
yer felly-crachurs into sin. Now cannebalism
is a sin; it ud be a sin capital for these fellies
to ate us; an', av coorse, it follies that it ud be
a sin in me to timpt um to do it. But, by sufferin'
meself to be worshipped I prevint that
same. So, I advise an' counsel, Heller, that we
go on as we are for a bit longer, until a proper
time comes to expose the whole av the thrue
faith.&quot;</p>

<p>Beguiling the way with such like discourse,
Father Higgins journeyed on to the nearest
village, where his bearers halted before an unusually
large hut, evidently serving as a temple.
In the door of this building the principal chief
took post, and waving his hand toward the
crowd, made the following speech:</p>

<p>&quot;Hear, O chiefs! hear, O priests of our religion
ye men of Feejee, hear! The god who
can come over the waters is greater than the
god who can only abide upon the land, and
shall have his house and his sacrifices. Whosoever
disapproves of this, let him offer himself
for the trial of the sacred poison; if he is not
ready so to do, let him hereafter hold his peace
and submit.&quot;</p>

<p>No one objecting, the chief beckoned the
bearers to follow him, and led the way into the
temple. Mounting a platform eight or ten feet
high, he advanced to an ugly scarecrow of an
idol, slapped it, kicked it, and toppled it to the
ground. Then, with vast labor and much joyful
shouting, the ponderous form of Father
Higgins was hoisted aloft, and installed in the
seat of the dethroned deity. Next Professor
Heller was set down upon his feet beside an
altar which stood in front of the platform.</p>

<p>&quot;What are ye afther doin', Heller?&quot; inquired
the clergyman from his eminence.</p>

<p>&quot;I am about to sacrifice to your divinity two
green cocoa-nuts, two roasted bread-fruit, and
half a dozen fishes,&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I suppose it must be permitted,&quot;
sighed Father Higgins. &quot;Go on wid yer sacrifice,
me dear felly. I presume, av coorse, that
it will be in ordher for me to ate some av it.
Let the fishes be well cooked, by-the-way, and
sarved wid some kind av sauce. I'd almost as
lave be devoured meself as devour raw fishes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, I have some scruples,&quot; smiled the
mischievous professor. &quot;You might shock the
devotional feelings of your new worshippers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I insist upon it, Heller. I tell ye I won't
ate raw fishes to convart a continent av haythins,
much less a little bit island av 'um.&quot;</p>

<p>The fish being promptly broiled on the coals
of the altar, were handed up to Father Higgins
on a large leaf, together with one of the cocoa-nuts
and a bread-fruit. The worthy man immediately
proceeded to make a hearty meal,
vastly to the delight and confirmation in the
faith of his worshippers, they having never before
been blessed with a god who could fairly
and squarely eat his dinner. After another
brief speech from the chief, and a benediction
from the padre, the multitude dispersed.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it me unavoidable duty to live on this
perch, Heller?&quot; demanded Father Higgins.
&quot;Me opinion is that in that case I shall get
mightily tired av me mission. I'd about as
lave be a parrot, an' sit in a tin ring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Father, remember that blessed
saint who roosted for twenty years on the top
of a pillar,&quot; urged the professor. &quot;Stay where
you are until you have got a firm grip on the
faith of these cannibals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; assented Higgins, with a
yawn. &quot;But get me a bucket of wather, me
dear felly. Sure I must have some blessed an'
ready for use. The next time sarvice is conducted
here I propose to sprinkle the worshippers.
It'll benefit um in more ways nor wan, if
I'm a judge of ayther sowl or body.&quot;</p>

<p>Such was the installation of Bishop Higgins,
or, as the Feejeeans insisted upon considering
him, Divinity Higgins, over the diocese of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>There was something mysterious about the
Cannibal Islands. Time flew like a bird there;
the days seemed no more than minutes; they
were coming, and they were gone. Events,
emotions, changes of belief, transformations of
character, succeeded each other with magical
rapidity. Every thing was transacted at the
wildest speed of dreams; and yet, what was
strangest of all, every thing went smoothly and
naturally; nothing excited astonishment. In a
few days, or a few seconds, whatever the period
of time might have been, Father Higgins enjoyed
being Divinity Higgins.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it best for the eventual spiritual
interests av me paple that they should continue
to worship me for a while longer,&quot; he said to
Heller. &quot;Human nature in a savage state, ye
see, wont go at wan jump from a log av wood
to the thrue Deity. I'm playin' the part av a
steppin'-stone betwixt the two. Afther they've
larned to lift their sowls to Higgins, they'll be
able to go a bit higher, say to the saints first,
an' thin to the blissid Vargin, an' so on, wan
step at a time, till they've got the whole av it.
But it'll be mortial slow, I'm doubtin'. I
may have to bear an' forbear as I am for an
intire gineration av the poor crachurs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; assented the professor. &quot;Nothing
so injurious to weak eyes as too much light.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y' 'ave put it in a nutshell,&quot; replied the
priest. &quot;Sure an' that's the rason we're opposed
to gineral schoolin', an' to readin' the
Bible to the children. Y' are a masther mind,
Heller, an' ought to been in howly ordhers.
An' that brings me to another idee av high importince.
There should be somebody to run
about with howly wather an' exthrame unction,
an' the like. Now that business wouldn't shuit
me pheesical conformation, an' nayther would
it shuit the character I have to bear. It's
betther that you should do the outside
trampin', Heller. Ye know the tradditions an'
docthrines av the Church well enough, an'
y' are a dab at Latin. As for yer not bein' av
the prastely office, I'll jist lay hands on ye an'
qualify ye for the same. If it happens to be a
bit irregular, why, the ind justifies the manes,
ye remimber, or the ancient Fathers are all
wrong, which is onpossible. An' now, Heller,
do tell these poor, benighted, lazy loons that I
must have me coky-nuts fresh, an' as great a
variety av fish as can be procured in these
wathers. The chap that preshumes to bring
me an owld coky-nut I'll curse his basket an'
his shtore.&quot;</p>

<p>After a brief missionary effort, Heller reported
that the whole population of the island,
barring a few obstinate seniors, had been baptized.</p>

<p>&quot;That's well, me son,&quot; replied Father Higgins.
&quot;I s'pose y' 'ave done it rather on the
wholesale, sprinklin' a hundred or so at a fling,
but I've no doubt y' 'ave done it the best ye
could in the time y' 'ave had; and surely it's a
great work, no matter how done. As for the
apostates&mdash;I mane the fellows that stick to
their owld haythinism&mdash;it might be well to
make an example av a few av thim, jist for the
encouragemint av the faithful. Suppose ye
should organize an inquisition, or howly office,
Heller, an' conduct the proceedin's yerself intirely,
be way av seein' that they are regular
an' effective? Y' are parfectly able for it,
wid your knowledge av Church history.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not long before Heller was able to
state that all the old fogies and silver-grays
who remained alive had been converted.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but isn't that blissid news!&quot; responded
Father Higgins, joyfully. &quot;An'
wouldn't me brethren, the other biships, be
glad to hear that same concernin' their dioceses!
That's betther nor coky-nuts&mdash;of
which, be-the-way, I'm gettin' a bit tired. I
wondher, Heller, if some av these other islands
wouldn't furnish us a change of diet? If we
could find pataties an' grapes, it ud be a blessin'
to body an' sowl. Surely it ud be a good
deed to bring all this archypilago into the thrue
faith. Couldn't the chafe, now, take an army
out in his doubled-barrelled canoes, an' commince
the work av convarsion? Tell him if
he'll do that same, I'll grant him all the indulgences
he can think av.&quot;</p>

<p>Another magical moment of these lightning-like
days brought about important events.
With an armament of scores of canoes and
hundreds of warriors the chief invaded a large
island, and was beaten in a bloody battle by its
painim inhabitants, escaping with but a remnant
of his followers. Then came a counter
invasion. The worshippers of Father Higgins
fought for their deity under his eye; the unbelievers
were defeated and driven with great
slaughter to their dug-outs. But as the hostile
fleet still held command of the sea and hovered
menacingly off the coast, keeping the faithful
under arms and preventing them from fishing,
the good Father decided that peace was necessary.</p>

<p>&quot;This livin' on coky-nuts and bread-fruits
intirely is bad for the stomich, Heller,&quot; he observed.
&quot;We must come to an ondherstandin'
wid these raskilly infidels an' idolaters. See if
ye can't make tarms wid um.&quot;</p>

<p>The adroit Heller soon arranged a secret
treaty with the enemy to the following effect:
Their chief, Umbaho, was to be universal king
and his orthodox rival, Patoo-patoo, was to be
beheaded; polygamy, cannibalism, and the use
of the sacred poison were to continue in force;
both islands were to adore Father Higgins and
bring him sacrifices.</p>

<p>&quot;Seems to me they're mighty sevare
tarms,&quot; commented the Father. &quot;I'd 'a been
glad to get howld av a bit av timporal sovereighnty,
don't you see? Moreover, I'm
sorry about that poor divil, Patoo-patoo; he
was my first convart. Annyway, I'll give um
full absolution, so that death can't hurt um
sariously, an' I'll canonize him as a martyr.
Saint Patoo-patoo! If that don't satisfy um,
an' if he ain't willin' to die for the extinsion av
the faith, he's no thrue belayver, and desarves
no pity. So jist see to gettin' um off aisy.&quot;</p>

<p>After another brief period of time, such as
periods of time were in these mysterious
islands, Father Higgins found himself the acknowledged
divinity of the whole archipelago.</p>

<p>&quot;This cannebalism an' polygamy an' the
like greatly distresses me, however,&quot; he confessed
to Heller. &quot;Be moments I'm timpted
to unfold the naked truth, an' bring these paple
square up to the canons of the Church at wanst.
But it ud be risky. We read av times, ye
know, Heller, that God winked at. No doubt
it's me duty, as a divinity, to go on winkin'
at these polygamies an' cannebalisms a bit
longer. Slow an' aisy is me motto, an' I've
noticed it's the way of Providence mostly.
Sure it was so at home in Sableburg, ye know,
Heller; we didn't average a convart in twinty
years.&quot;</p>

<p>Now ensued an event which troubled the
holy Father more than any thing that had yet
occurred during his episcopate. Two German
priests, Heller informed him, had landed on
one of the islands of the archipelago, and were
preaching the pure doctrines of the Christian
faith, denouncing cannibalism and polygamy,
and otherwise sapping the established religion.</p>

<p>&quot;Some av the New Catholics, I'll warrant
ye!&quot; exclaimed Higgins, indignantly. &quot;Some
of thim blatherskites av the D&ouml;llinger school,
come over here to stir up sedition in the Church,
as though they hadn't made worry enough in
the owld counthries. An' what business has
Dutchmen here, annyway, whin an Irishman
has begun the good worrk? They've no right
to take the labor of convartin' these haythins
out of me hands that a-way. Me conscience
won't allow me to permit such distarbances an'
innovations. See if ye can't get um to lave
the islands peaceable, Heller. If they won't, I
shall have to let Umbaho settle wid um afther
his fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>An embassy to the missionaries having obtained
from them no other response than
that they would welcome martyrdom rather
than relinquish their labors, Umbaho was dispatched
against them at the head of a sufficient
army, with instructions to treat them as enemies
of Feejee and of the unity of the Church.</p>

<p>But instead of slaughtering the missionaries,
Umbaho was converted by them. He renounced
cannibalism, polygamy, and the sacred
poison; he denied Father Higgins. Accompanied
by one of the Germans, he returned
to Feejee at the head of his army, bent on establishing
the true Christian faith.</p>

<p>&quot;We must press a lot av min, an' beat um,&quot;
responded the good Father, when Heller informed
him of the approach and purposes of
the chief. &quot;Tell the faithful to give no quarter;
tell um to desthroy ivery wan of these schismatics;
an' as for the Dutchman, burrn him at the
stake, as they used to do in the good owld times.&quot;</p>

<p>A great battle ensued; the adherents of
Higginsism were defeated and dispersed; the
door of the temple opened to Umbaho and the
German. Father Higgins, by this time a helpless
mass of fat, swaying perilously on his unsteady
platform, looked down upon them with
terror through the smoke of his altar.</p>

<p>&quot;Sacrilegious wretch!&quot; cried the German,
God has put an end to thy mad and selfish and
wicked dominion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I had niver been a biship!&quot; screamed
Father Higgins at the top of his voice, as he
rolled off the platform.</p>

<p>All the way from the Cannibal Islands he
fell and tumbled and dropped, until, with a
dull thump, he alighted upon the floor of his
own study.</p>

<p>&quot;There! y' 'ave rolled out av yer chair
agen, Father Higgins,&quot; said his housekeeper,
who at that moment entered the room to order
him to bed, as was her merciful custom.</p>

<p>&quot;So I have,&quot; returned the Father, picking
himself up. &quot;An' sarved me right, too. I
thought I was the biggest raskil on the face
av the earth. I wondher if it's true. The
Lord presarve me from the timptation av great
power, or I'll abuse it, an' abuse me felly-men
and the Church!&quot;&mdash;<i>Harper's Magazine</i>, May,

<p>Did I never tell you the story? Is it
possible? Draw up your chair. Stick
of wood, Harry. Smoke?</p>

<p>You've heard of my Uncle Popworth,
though. Why, yes! You've seen him;&mdash;the
eminently respectable elderly gentleman who
came one day last summer just as you were
going; book under his arm, you remember;
weed on his hat; dry smile on bland countenance;
tall, lank individual in very seedy black.
With him my tale begins; for if I had never
indulged in an Uncle Popworth I should never
have sported an Iron-Clad.</p>

<p>Quite right, sir; his arrival <i>was</i> a surprise to
me. To know how great a surprise, you must
understand why I left city, friends, business,
and settled down in this quiet village. It was
chiefly, sir, to escape the fascinations of that
worthy old gentleman that I bought this place,
and took refuge here with my wife and little
ones. Here we had respite, respite and nepenthe
from our memories of Uncle Popworth;
here we used to sit down in the evening and
talk of the past with grateful and tranquil emotions,
as people speak of awful things endured
in days that are no more. To us the height of
human happiness was raising green corn and
strawberries, in a retired neighborhood where
uncles were unknown. But, sir, when that
Phantom, that Vampire, that Fate, loomed
before my vision that day, if you had said,
&quot;Trover, I'll give ye sixpence for this neat
little box of yours,&quot; I should have said,
&quot;Done!&quot; with the trifling proviso that you
should take my uncle in the bargain.</p>

<p>The matter with him? What indeed could
invest human flesh with such terrors,&mdash;what
but this? he was&mdash;he is&mdash;let me shriek it in
your ear&mdash;a bore&mdash;a BORE! of the most malignant
type; an intolerable, terrible, unmitigated
BORE!</p>

<p>That book under his arm was a volume of
his own sermons;&mdash;nine hundred and ninety-nine
octavo pages, O Heaven! It wasn't
enough for him to preach and re-preach those
appalling discourses, but then the ruthless man
must go and print 'em! When I consider what
booksellers&mdash;worthy men, no doubt, many of
them, deserving well of their kind&mdash;he must
have talked nearly into a state of syncope
before ever he found one to give way, in a
moment of weakness, of utter exhaustion and
despair, and consent to publish him; and when
I reflect what numbers of inoffensive persons,
in the quiet walks of life, have been made to
suffer the infliction of that Bore's Own Book, I
pause, I stand aghast at the inscrutability of
Divine Providence.</p>

<p>Don't think me profane, and don't for a
moment imagine I underrate the function of
the preacher. There's nothing better than a
good sermon,&mdash;one that puts new life into you.
But what of a sermon that takes life out of
you? instead of a spiritual fountain, a spiritual
sponge that absorbs your powers of body and
soul, so that the longer you listen the more
you are impoverished? A merely poor sermon
isn't so bad; you will find, if you are the right
kind of a hearer, that it will suggest something
better than itself; a good hen will lay to a bit of
earthen. But the discourse of your ministerial
vampire, fastening by some mystical process
upon the hearer who has life of his own,&mdash;though
not every one has that,&mdash;sucks and
sucks and sucks; and he is exhausted while the
preacher is refreshed. So it happens that your
born bore is never weary of his own boring; he
thrives upon it; while he seems to be giving,
he is mysteriously taking in&mdash;he is drinking
your blood.</p>

<p>But you say nobody is obliged to <i>read</i> a sermon.
O my unsophisticated friend! if a man
will put his thoughts&mdash;or his words, if thoughts
are lacking&mdash;between covers,&mdash;spread his banquet,
and respectfully invite Public Taste to
partake of it, Public Taste being free to decline,
then your observation is sound. If an author
quietly buries himself in his book,&mdash;very good!
hic jacet; peace to his ashes!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">&quot;The times have been,</span><br />
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,<br />
And there an end; but now they rise again,&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>as Macbeth observes, with some confusion of
syntax, excusable in a person of his circumstances.
Now, suppose they&mdash;or he&mdash;the man
whose brains are out&mdash;goes about with his
coffin under his arm, like my worthy uncle?
and suppose he blandly, politely, relentlessly
insists upon reading to you, out of that octavo
sarcophagus, passages which in his opinion
prove that he is not only not dead, but immortal?
If such a man be a stranger, snub
him; if a casual acquaintance, met in an evil
hour, there is still hope,&mdash;doors have locks, and
there are two sides to a street, and nearsightedness
is a blessing, and (as a last resort) buttons
may be sacrificed (you remember Lamb's story
of Coleridge), and left in the clutch of the fatal
fingers. But one of your own kindred, and very
respectable, adding the claim of misfortune to
his other claims upon you,&mdash;pachydermatous to
slights, smilingly persuasive, gently persistent,&mdash;as
imperturbable as a ship's wooden figurehead
through all the ups and downs of the
voyage of life, and as insensible to cold water;&mdash;in
short, an uncle like my uncle, whom there
was no getting rid of;&mdash;what the deuce would
you do?</p>

<p>Exactly; run away as I did. There was
nothing else to be done, unless, indeed, I had
throttled the old gentleman; in which case I
am confident that one of our modern model
juries would have brought in the popular verdict
of justifiable insanity. But, being a peaceable
man, I was averse to extreme measures.
So I did the next best thing,&mdash;consulted my
wife, and retired to this village.</p>

<p>Then consider the shock to my feelings when
I looked up that day and saw the enemy of our
peace stalking into our little Paradise with his
book under his arm and his carpet-bag in his
hand! coming with his sermons and his shirts,
prepared to stay a week&mdash;that is to say a year&mdash;that
is to say forever, if we would suffer him,&mdash;and
how was he to be hindered by any desperate
measures short of burning the house
down!</p>

<p>&quot;My dear nephew!&quot; says he, striding toward
me with eager steps, as you perhaps remember,
smiling his eternally dry, leathery smile,&mdash;&quot;Nephew
Frederick!&quot;&mdash;and he held out both
hands to me, book in one and bag in t'other,&mdash;&quot;I
am rejoiced! One would almost think you
had tried to hide away from your old uncle!
for I've been three days hunting you up. And
how is Dolly? she ought to be glad to see me,
after all the trouble I've had in finding you!
And, Nephew Frederick!&mdash;h'm!&mdash;can you lend
me three dollars for the hackman? for I don't
happen to have&mdash;thank you! I should have
been saved this if you had only known I was
stopping last night at a public house in the
next village, for I know how delighted you
would have been to drive over and fetch me!&quot;</p>

<p>If you were not already out of hearing, you
may have noticed that I made no reply to this
affecting speech. The old gentleman has grown
quite deaf of late years,&mdash;an infirmity which
was once a source of untold misery to his
friends, to whom he was constantly appealing
for their opinions, which they were obliged to
shout in his ear. But now, happily, the world
has about ceased responding to him, and he
has almost ceased to expect responses from the
world. He just catches your eye, and, when
he says, &quot;Don't you think so, sir?&quot; or, &quot;What
is your opinion, sir?&quot; an approving nod does
your business.</p>

<p>The hackman paid, my dear uncle accompanied
me to the house, unfolding the catalogue
of his woes by the way. For he is one of those
worthy, unoffending persons, whom an ungrateful
world jostles and tramples upon,&mdash;whom unmerciful
disaster follows fast and follows faster.
In his younger days, he was settled over I
don't know how many different parishes; but
secret enmity pursued him everywhere, poisoning
the parochial mind against him, and driving
him relentlessly from place to place. Then he
relapsed into agencies, and went through a long
list of them, each terminating in flat failure, to
his ever-recurring surprise,&mdash;the simple old soul
never suspecting, to this day, who his one great,
tireless, terrible enemy is!</p>

<p>I got him into the library, and went to talk
over this unexpected visit&mdash;or visitation&mdash;with
Dolly. She bore up under it more cheerfully
than could have been expected,&mdash;suppressed a
sigh,&mdash;and said she would go down and meet
him. She received him with a hospitable smile
(I verily believe that more of the world's
hypocrisy proceeds from too much good-nature
than from too little), and listened patiently to
his explanations.</p>

<p>&quot;You will observe that I have brought my
bag,&quot; says he, &quot;for I knew you wouldn't let
me off for a day or two,&mdash;though I must positively
leave in a week,&mdash;in two weeks, at the
latest. I have brought my volume, too, for I
am contemplating a new edition&quot; (he is always
contemplating a new edition, making that a
pretext for lugging the book about with him),
&quot;and I wish to enjoy the advantages of your
and Frederick's criticism;&mdash;I anticipate some
good, comfortable, old-time talks over the old
book, Frederick!&quot;</p>

<p>We had invited some village friends to come
in and eat strawberries and cream with us that
afternoon; and the question arose, what should
be done with the old gentleman? Harry, who
is a lad of a rather lively fancy, coming in
while we were taking advantage of his great
uncle's deafness to discuss the subject in his
presence, proposed a pleasant expedient.
&quot;Trot him out into the cornfield, introduce
him to the scarecrow, and let him talk to
that,&quot; says he, grinning up into the visitor's
face, who grinned down at him, no doubt thinking
what a wonderfully charming boy he was!
If he were as blind as he is deaf, he might have
been disposed of very comfortably in some such
ingenious way;&mdash;the scarecrow, or any other
lay figure, might have served to engage him in
one of his immortal monologues. As it was,
the suggestion bore fruit later, as you will see.</p>

<p>While we were consulting&mdash;keeping up our
scattering fire of small-arms under the old
talker's heavy guns&mdash;our parish minister called,&mdash;old
Doctor Wortleby, for whom we have a
great liking and respect. Of course we had to
introduce him to Uncle Popworth,&mdash;for they
met face to face; and of course Uncle Popworth
fastened at once upon the brother clergyman.
Being my guest, Wortleby could do no
less than listen to Popworth, who is my uncle.
He listened with interest and sympathy for the
first half-hour; and then continued listening
for another half-hour, after his interest and
sympathy were exhausted. Then, attempting
to go, he got his hat, and sat with it in his
hand half an hour longer. Then he stood half
an hour on his poor old gouty feet, desperately
edging toward the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, certainly,&quot; says he, with a weary smile,
repeatedly endeavoring to break the spell that
bound him. &quot;I shall be most happy to hear
the conclusion of your remarks at some future
time&quot; (even ministers can lie out of politeness);
&quot;but just now&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One word more, and I am done,&quot; cries my
Uncle Popworth, for the fiftieth time; and
Wortleby, in despair, sat down again.</p>

<p>Then our friends arrived.</p>

<p>Dolly and I, who had all the while been
benevolently wishing Wortleby would go, and
trying to help him off, now selfishly hoped he
would remain and share our entertainment&mdash;and
our Uncle Popworth.</p>

<p>&quot;I ought to have gone two hours ago,&quot; he
said, with a plaintive smile, in reply to our invitation;
&quot;but, really, I am feeling the need of
a cup of tea&quot; (and no wonder!) &quot;and I think I
will stay.&quot;</p>

<p>We cruelly wished that he might continue to
engage my uncle in conversation; but that
would have been too much to hope from the
sublime endurance of a martyr,&mdash;if ever there
was one more patient than he. Seeing the
Lintons and the Greggs arrive, he craftily
awaited his opportunity, and slipped off, to
give them a turn on the gridiron. First Linton
was secured; and you should have seen him
roll his mute, appealing orbs, as he settled
helplessly down under the infliction. Suddenly
he made a dash. &quot;I am ignorant of these
matters,&quot; said he; &quot;but Gregg understands
them;&mdash;Gregg will talk with you.&quot; But Gregg
took refuge behind the ladies. The ladies
receiving a hint from poor distressed Dolly,
scattered. But no artifice availed against the
dreadful man. Piazza, parlor, garden,&mdash;he
ranged everywhere, and was sure to seize a
victim.</p>

<p>At last tea was ready, and we all went in.
The Lintons and Greggs are people of the
world, who would hardly have cared to wait for
a blessing on such lovely heaps of strawberries
and mugs of cream as they saw before them;
but, there being two clergymen at the table,
the ceremony was evidently expected. We
were placidly seated; there was a hush, agreeably
filled with the fragrance of the delicious
fruit: even my uncle Popworth, from long
habit, turned off his talk at that suggestive
moment: when I did what I thought a shrewd
thing. I knew too well my relative's long-windedness
at his devotions, as at everything
else (I wonder if Heaven itself isn't bored by
such fellows!)&mdash;I had suffered, I had seen my
guests suffer, too much from him already,&mdash;to
think of deliberately yielding him a fearful advantage
over us; so I coolly passed him by, and
gave an expressive nod to the old Doctor.</p>

<p>Wortleby began; and I was congratulating
myself on my adroit management of a delicate
matter, when&mdash;conceive my consternation!&mdash;Popworth&mdash;not
to speak it profanely&mdash;followed
suit! The reverend egotist couldn't take in
the possibility of anybody but himself being
invited to say grace at our table, he being
present;&mdash;he hadn't noticed my nod to the
Doctor, and the Doctor's low, earnest voice
didn't reach him;&mdash;and there, with one blessing
going on one side of the table, he, as I said,
pitched in on the other! His eyes shut, his
hands spread over his plate, his elbows on the
board, his head bowed, he took care that grace
should abound with us for once! His mill
started, I knew there was no stopping it, and I
hoped Wortleby would desist. But he didn't
know his man. He seemed to feel that he had
the stroke-oar, and he pulled away manfully.
As Popworth lifted up his loud, nasal voice, the
old Doctor raised his voice, in the vain hope, I
suppose, of making himself heard by his lusty
competitor. If you have never had two blessings
running opposition at your table, in the
presence of invited guests, you can never imagine
how astounding, how killingly ludicrous
it was! I felt that both Linton and Gregg were
ready to tumble over, each in an apoplexy of
suppressed emotions; while I had recourse to
my handkerchief to hide my tears. At length,
poor Wortleby yielded to fate,&mdash;withdrew from
the unequal contest&mdash;hauled off&mdash;for repairs;
and the old seventy-two gun-ship thundered
away in triumph.</p>

<p>At last (as there must be an end to everything
under the sun) my uncle came to a close;
and a moment of awful silence ensued, during
which no man durst look at another. But in
my weak and jelly-like condition I ventured a
glance at him, and noticed that he looked up
and around with an air of satisfaction at having
performed a solemn duty in a becoming
manner, blissfully unconscious of having run a
poor brother off the track. Seeing us all with
moist eyes and much affected,&mdash;two or three
handkerchiefs still going,&mdash;he no doubt flattered
himself that the pathetic touches in his prayer
had told.</p>

<p>This will give you some idea of the kind of
man we had on our hands; and I won't risk
making myself as great a bore as he is, by attempting
a history of his stay with us; for I
remember I set out to tell you about my little
Iron-Clad. I'm coming to that.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, he stayed&mdash;he <i>stayed</i>&mdash;he
STAYED!&mdash;five mortal weeks; refusing to take
hints when they almost became kicks; driving
our friends from us, and ourselves almost to
distraction; his misfortunes alone protecting
him from a prompt and vigorous elimination:
when a happy chance helped me to a solution
of this awful problem of destiny.</p>

<p>More than once I had recalled Harry's vivacious
suggestion of the scarecrow&mdash;if one
could only have been invented that would sit
composedly in a chair and nod when spoken
to! I was wishing for some such automaton,
to bear the brunt of the boring with which we
were afflicted, when one day there came a little
man into the garden, where I had taken
refuge.</p>

<p>He was a short, swarthy, foreign-looking,
diminutive, stiff, rather comical fellow,&mdash;little
figure mostly head, little head mostly face, little
face mostly nose, which was by no means
little&mdash;a sort of human vegetable (to my horticultural
eye) running marvellously to seed in
that organ. The first thing I saw, on looking
up at the sound of footsteps, was the said nose
coming toward me, among the sweet-corn
tassels. Nose of a decidedly Hebraic cast,&mdash;the
bearer respectably dressed, though his
linen had an unwholesome sallowness, and his
cloth a shiny, much-brushed, second-hand appearance.</p>

<p>Without a word he walks up to me, bows
solemnly, and pulls from his pocket (I thought
he was laying his hand on his heart) the familiar,
much-worn weapon of his class,&mdash;the
folded, torn yellow paper, ready to fall to
pieces as you open it,&mdash;in short, the respectable
beggar's certificate of character. With
another bow (which gave his nose the aspect
of the beak of a bird of prey making a pick at
me) he handed the document. I found that
it was dated in Milwaukee, and signed by the
mayor of that city, two physicians, three
clergymen, and an editor, who bore united
testimony to the fact that Jacob Menzel&mdash;I
think that was his name&mdash;the bearer, any way,&mdash;was
a deaf mute, and, considering that fact,
a prodigy of learning, being master of no less
than five different languages (a pathetic circumstance,
considering that he was unable to
speak one); moreover, that he was a converted
Jew; and, furthermore, a native of Germany,
who had come to this country in company with
two brothers, both of whom had died of cholera
in St. Louis in one day; in consequence of
which affliction, and his recent conversion, he
was now anxious to return to Fatherland,
where he proposed to devote his life to the
conversion of his brethren;&mdash;the upshot of all
which was that good Christians and charitable
souls everywhere were earnestly recommended
to aid the said Jacob Menzel in his pious undertaking.</p>

<p>I was fumbling in my pocket for a little
change wherewith to dismiss him,&mdash;for that is
usually the easiest way of getting off your
premises and your conscience the applicant for
&quot;aid,&quot; who is probably an impostor, yet possibly
not,&mdash;when my eye caught the words
(for I still held the document), &quot;would be glad
of any employment which may help to pay his
way.&quot; The idea of finding employment for a
man of such a large nose and little body, such
extensive knowledge and diminutive legs&mdash;who
had mastered five languages yet could not
speak or understand a word of any one of them,&mdash;struck
me as rather pleasant, to say the least;
yet, after a moment's reflection,&mdash;wasn't he the
very thing I wanted, the manikin, the target for
my uncle?</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was scribbling rapidly on a
small slate he had taken from his pocket.
With another bow (as if he had written something
wrong and was going to wipe it out with
his nose), he handed me the slate, on which I
found written in a neat hand half-a-dozen lines
in as many different languages,&mdash;English, Latin,
Hebrew, German, French, Greek,&mdash;each, as far
as I could make out, conveying the cheerful information
that he could communicate with me
in that particular tongue. I tried him in English,
French, and Latin, and I must acknowledge
that he stood the test; he then tried me In
Greek and Hebrew, and I as freely confess that
I didn't stand the test. He smiled intelligently,
nodded, and condescendingly returned
to the English tongue, writing quickly,&mdash;&quot;I am
a poor exile from Fatherland, and I much need
friends.&quot;</p>

<p>I wrote: &quot;You wish employment?&quot; He replied:
&quot;I shall be much obliged for any service
I shall be capable to do,&quot;&mdash;and passed me the
slate with a hopeful smile.</p>

<p>&quot;What can you do?&quot; I asked. He answered:
&quot;I copy the manuscripts, I translate from the
one language to others with some perfect exactitude,
I arrange the libraries, I make the catalogues,
I am capable to be any secretary.&quot; And
he looked up as if he saw in my eyes a vast
vista of catalogues, manuscripts, libraries, and
Fatherland at the end of it.</p>

<p>&quot;How would you like to be companion to
a literary man?&quot; I inquired.</p>

<p>He nodded expressively, and wrote: &quot;I
should that like overall. But I speak and
hear not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No matter,&quot; I replied. &quot;You will only
have to sit and appear to listen, and nod occasionally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall be the gentleman?&quot; he asked
with a bright, pleased look.</p>

<p>I explained to him that the gentleman was an
unfortunate connection of my family, whom we
could not regard as being quite in his right
mind.</p>

<p>Jacob Menzel smiled, and touched his fore
head interrogatively.</p>

<p>I nodded, adding on the slate,&mdash;&quot;He is perfectly
harmless; but he can only be kept quiet
by having some person to talk and read to. He
will talk and read to you. He must not know
you are deaf. He is very deaf himself, and will
not expect you to reply.&quot; And, for a person
wishing a light and easy employment, I recommended
the situation.</p>

<p>He wrote at once, &quot;How much you pay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One dollar a day, and board you,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>He of the nose nodded eagerly at that, and
wrote, &quot;Also you make to be washed my
shirt?&quot;</p>

<p>I agreed; and the bargain was closed. I got
him into the house, and gave him a bath, a
clean shirt, and complete instructions how to
act.</p>

<p>The gravity with which he entered upon the
situation was astonishing. He didn't seem to
taste the slightest flavor of a joke in it all.
It was a simple matter of business; he saw in it
only money and Fatherland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I explained my intentions to Dolly,
saying in great glee: &quot;His deafness is his
defence: the old three-decker may bang away at
him; he is IRON-CLAD!&quot; And that suggested
the name we have called him by ever since.</p>

<p>When he was ready for action, I took him in
tow, and ran him in to draw the Popworth's
fire&mdash;in other words, introduced him to my
uncle in the library. The meeting of my tall,
lank relative and the big-nosed little Jew was a
spectacle to cure a hypochondriac! &quot;Mr. Jacob
Menzel&mdash;gentleman from Germany&mdash;travelling
in this country,&quot; I yelled in the old fellow's
ear. He of the diminutive legs and stupendous
nose bowed with perfect decorum, and seated
himself, stiff and erect, in the big chair I placed
for him. The avuncular countenance lighted
up: here were fresh woods and pastures new to
that ancient shepherd. As for myself, I was
wellnigh strangled by a cough which just then
seized me, and obliged to retreat,&mdash;for I never
was much of an actor, and the comedy of that
first interview was overpowering.</p>

<p>As I passed the dining-room door, Dolly, who
was behind it, gave my arm a fearful pinch, that
answered, I supposed, in the place of a scream,
as a safety-valve for her hysterical emotions.
&quot;O you cruel man&mdash;you miserable humbug!&quot;
says she; and went off into convulsions of
laughter. The door was open, and we could
see and hear every thing.</p>

<p>&quot;You are travelling, h'm?&quot; says my uncle.
The nose nodded duly. &quot;H'm! I have travelled,
myself,&quot; the old gentleman proceeded;
&quot;my life has been one of vicissitudes, h'm! I
have journeyed, I have preached, I have published;&mdash;perhaps
you have heard of my literary
venture&quot;&mdash;and over went the big volume to the
little man, who took it, turned the leaves, and
nodded and smiled, according to instructions.</p>

<p>&quot;You are very kind to say so; thank you!&quot;
says my uncle, rubbing his husky hands with
satisfaction. &quot;Rejoiced to meet with you,
truly! It is always a gratification to have an
intelligent and sympathizing brother to open
one's mind to; it is especially refreshing to me,
for, as I may say without egotism, my life and
labors have <i>not</i> been appreciated.&quot;</p>

<p>From that the old interminable story took its
start and flowed on, the faithful nose nodding
assent at every turn in that winding stream.</p>

<p>The children came in for their share of the
fun; and for the first time in our lives we took
pleasure in the old gentleman's narration of his
varied experiences.</p>

<p>&quot;O hear him! see him go it!&quot; said Robbie.
&quot;What a nose!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Long may it wave!&quot; said Harry.</p>

<p>With other remarks of a like genial nature;
while there they sat, the two,&mdash;my uncle on
one side, long, lathy, self-satisfied, gesticulating,
earnestly laying his case before a grave
jury of one, whom he was bound to convince,
if time would allow; my little Jew facing him,
upright in his chair, stiff, imperturbable, devoted
to business, honorably earning his money, the
nose in the air, immovable, except when it
played duly up and down at fitting intervals:
in which edifying employment I left them, and
went about my business, a cheerier man.</p>

<p>Ah, what a relief it was to feel myself free
for a season from the attacks of the enemy&mdash;to
know that my plucky little Iron-Clad was engaging
him! In a hour I passed through the
hall again, heard the loud blatant voice still
discoursing (it had got as far as the difficulties
with the second parish), and saw the unflinching
nasal organ perform its graceful see-saw
of assent. An hour later it was the same,&mdash;except
that the speaker had arrived at the
persecutions which drove him from parish number
three. When I went to call them to dinner,
the scene had changed a little, for now the old
gentleman, pounding the table for a pulpit, was
reading aloud passages from a powerful farewell
sermon preached to his ungrateful parishioners.
I was sorry I couldn't give my man a
hint to use his handkerchief at the affecting
periods, for the nose can hardly be called a
sympathetic feature (unless indeed you blow it),
and these nods were becoming rather too mechanical,
except when the old gentleman switched
off on the argumentative track, as he frequently
did. &quot;What think you of that?&quot; he
would pause in his reading to inquire. &quot;Isn't
that logic? isn't that unanswerable?&quot; In responding
to which appeals nobody could have
done better than my serious, my devoted, my
lovely little Jew.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinner!&quot; I shouted over my uncle's dickey.
It was almost the only word that had the
magic in it to rouse him from the feast of reason
which his own conversation was to him. It
was always easy to head him toward the dining-room&mdash;to
steer him into port for necessary
supplies. The little Iron-Clad followed in his
wake. At table, the old gentleman resumed
the account of his dealings with parish number
three, and got on as far as negotiations with
number four; occasionally stopping to eat his
soup or roast-beef very fast; at which time
Jacob Menzel, who was very much absorbed
in his dinner, but never permitted himself to
neglect business for pleasure, paused at the
proper intervals, with his spoon or fork half-way
to his mouth, and nodded,&mdash;just as if my
uncle had been speaking,&mdash;yielding assent to
his last remarks after mature consideration, no
doubt the old gentleman thought.</p>

<p>The fun of the thing wore off after a while,
and then we experienced the solid advantages
of having an Iron-Clad in the house; Afternoon&mdash;evening&mdash;the
next day&mdash;my little man
of business performed his function promptly
and assiduously. But in the afternoon of the
second day he began to change perceptibly.
He wore an aspect of languor and melancholy
that alarmed me. The next morning he was
pale, and went to his work with an air of sorrowful
resignation.</p>

<p>&quot;He is thinking of Fatherland,&quot; said the sympathizing
Dolly; while Harry's less refined but
more sprightly comment was, that the nose had
about played out.</p>

<p>Indeed it had almost ceased to wave; and I
feared that I was about to lose a most valuable
servant, whose place it would be impossible to
fill. Accordingly I wrote on a slip of paper,
which I sent in to him,&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You have done well, and I raise your salary
to a dollar and a quarter a day. Your influence
over our unfortunate relative is soothing and
beneficial. Go on as you have begun,&mdash;continue
in well-doing, and merit the lasting gratitude
of an afflicted family.&quot;</p>

<p>That seemed to cheer him a little&mdash;to wind
him up, as Harry said, and set the pendulum
swinging again. But it was not long before
the listlessness and low spirits returned; Menzel
showed a sad tendency to shirk his duty;
and before noon there came a crash.</p>

<p>I was in the garden, when I heard a shriek
of rage and despair, and saw the little Jew
coming toward me with frantic gestures.</p>

<p>&quot;I yielt! I abandone! I take my moneys
and my shirt, and I go!&quot; says he.</p>

<p>I stood in perfect astonishment at hearing
the dumb speak; while he threw his arms
wildly above his head, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&quot;I am not teaf! I am not teaf! I am not
teaf! He is one terreeble mon! He vill haf
my life! So I go&mdash;I fly&mdash;I take my moneys
and my shirt&mdash;I leafe him, I leafe your house!
I vould earn honest living, but&mdash;Gott im himmel!
dieu des dieux! all de devils!&quot; he shrieked,
mixing up several of his languages at once, in
his violent mental agitation.</p>

<p>&quot;Jacob Menzel!&quot; said I, solemnly, &quot;I little
thought I was having to do with an impostor!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I haf you deceive, I haf myself more
dan punish!&quot; was his reply. &quot;Now I resign
de position. I ask for de moneys and de shirt,
and I part!&quot;</p>

<p>Just then my uncle came up, amazed at his
new friend's sudden revolt and flight, and
anxious to finish up with his seventh parish.
&quot;I vill hear no more of your six, of your
seven,&mdash;I know not how many parish!&quot;
screamed the furious little Jew, turning on
him.</p>

<p>&quot;What means all this?&quot; said my bewildered
uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you vat means it all!&quot; the vindictive
little impostor, tiptoeing up to him, yelled at
his cheek. &quot;I make not vell my affairs in your
country; I vould return to Faderlant; for conwenience
I carry dis pappeer. I come here; I
am suppose teaf; I accept de position to be
your companion, for if a man hear, you kill
him tead soon vid your book and your ten,
twenty parish! I hear! you kill me! and I go!&quot;</p>

<p>And, having obtained his moneys and his
shirt, he went. That is the last I ever saw of
my little Iron-Clad. I remember him with gratitude,
for he did me good service, and he had
but one fault, namely, that he was <i>not</i> iron-clad!</p>

<p>As for my uncle, for the first time in his life,
I think, he said never a word, but stalked into
the house. Dolly soon came running out to
ask what was the matter; Popworth was actually
packing his carpet-bag! I called Andrew, and
ordered him to be in readiness with the buggy
to take the old gentleman over to the railroad.</p>

<p>&quot;What! going?&quot; I cried, as my uncle presently
appeared, bearing his book and his baggage.</p>

<p>&quot;Nephew Frederick!&quot; said he, &quot;after this
treatment, can you ask me if am going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really,&quot; I shouted, &quot;it is not my fault that
the fellow proved an impostor. I employed him
with the best of intentions, for your&mdash;and our&mdash;good!&quot;
&quot;Nephew Frederick,&quot; said he, &quot;this is insufferable;
you will regret it! I shall never&mdash;NEVER&quot;
(as if he had been pronouncing my
doom)&mdash;&quot;accept of your hospitalities again!&quot;</p>

<p>He did, however, accept some money which
I offered him, and likewise a seat in the buggy.
I watched his departure with joy and terror,&mdash;for
at any moment he might relent and stay
nor was I at ease in my mind until I saw Andrew
come riding back alone.</p>

<p>We have never seen the old gentleman since
But last winter I received a letter from him
he wrote in a forgiving tone, to inform me that
he had been appointed chaplain in a prison, and
to ask for a loan of money to buy a suit of
clothes. I sent him fifty dollars and my congratulations.
I consider him eminently qualified
to fill the new situation. As a hardship
he can't be beat; and what are the rogues sent
to prison for, but to suffer punishment?</p>

<p>Yes, it would be a joke if my little Iron-Clad
should end his career of imposture in that public
institution, and sit once more under my excellent
uncle! But I can't wish him any such
misfortune. His mission to us was one of mercy.
The place has been Paradise again, ever since
his visit.&mdash;<i>Scribners Magazine</i>, August, 1873.</p>

AND KINDRED THEMES.</h2>

<p>(<i>In a Country Lane</i>.)</p>

<p>BACHELOR BLUFF.
A LISTENER.</p>


<p>&quot;The country,&quot; exclaimed Mr. Bluff, with
an air of candor and impartiality,
&quot;is, I admit, a very necessary and sometimes
a very charming place. I thank Heaven for
the country when I eat my first green peas,
when the lettuce is crisp, when the potatoes are
delicate and mealy, when the well-fed poultry
comes to town, when the ruddy peach and the
purple grape salute me at the fruit-stands. I
love the country when I think of a mountain
ramble; when I am disposed to wander with
rod and reel along the forest-shadowed brook;
when the apple-orchards are in blossom; when
the hills blaze with autumn foliage. But I protest
against the dogmatism of rural people,
who claim all the cardinal and all the remaining
virtues for their rose-beds and cabbage-patches.
The town, sir, bestows felicities higher in character
than the country does; for men and
women, and the works of men and women, are
always worthier our love and concern than the
rocks and the hills ...</p>

<p>&mdash;&quot;Oh, yes! I have heard before of the
pleasures of the garden. Poets have sung, enthusiasts
have written, and old men have
dreamed of them since History began her
chronicles. But have the <i>pains</i> of the garden
ever been dwelt upon? Have people, now,
been entirely honest in what they have said
and written on this theme? When enthusiasts
have told us of their prize pears, their early
peas of supernatural tenderness, their asparagus,
and their roses, and their strawberries,
have they not hidden a good deal about their
worm-eaten plums&mdash;about their cherries that
were carried off by armies of burglarious birds;
about their potatoes that proved watery and
unpalatable; about their melons that fell victims
to their neighbors' fowls; about their
peaches that succumbed to the unexpected
raid of Jack Frost; about their grapes that fell
under the blight of mildew; about their green
corn that withered in the hill; about the
mighty host of failures that, if all were told,
would tower in high proportion above the few
much blazoned successes?</p>

<p>&quot;Who is it that says a garden is a standing
source of pleasure? Amend this, I say, by
asserting that a garden is a standing source of
discomfort and vexation ... A hopeless
restlessness, according to my observation, takes
possession of every amateur gardener. Discontent
abides in his soul. There is, indeed, so
much to be done, changed, rearranged, watched,
nursed, that the amateur gardener is really entitled
to praise and generous congratulations
when one of his thousand schemes comes to
fruition. We ought in pity to rejoice with him
over his big Lawton blackberries, and say
nothing of the cherries, and the pears, and the
peaches, that once were budding hopes, but
have gone the way of Moore's 'dear gazelle.'
Then the large expenditures which were needed
to bring about his triumph of the Lawtons.
'Those potatoes,' said an enthusiastic amateur
gardener to me once, 'cost twenty-five cents
apiece!' And they were very good potatoes,
too&mdash;almost equal to those that could be
bought in market at a dollar a bushel.</p>

<p>&quot;And then, amateur gardeners are feverishly
addicted to early rising. Men with gardens are
like those hard drinkers whose susceptibilities
are hopelessly blunted. Who but a man diverted
from the paths of honest feeling and
natural enjoyment, possessed of a demoniac
mania, lost to the peace and serenity of the
virtuous and the blessed, could find pleasure
amid the damps, and dews, and chills, and raw-edgedness
of a garden in the early morning,
absolutely find pleasure in saturated trousers,
in shoes swathed in moisture, in skies that are
gray and gloomy, in flowers that are, as Mantalini
would put it, 'demnition moist'? The
thing is incredible! Now, a garden, after the
sun has dried the paths, warmed the air, absorbed
the dew, is admissible. But a possession
that compels an early turning out into
fogs and discomforts deserves for this fact
alone the anathema of all rational beings.</p>

<p>&quot;I really believe, sir, that the literature of
the garden, so abundant everywhere, is written
in the interest of suburban land-owners. The
inviting one-sided picture so persistently held
up is only a covert bit of advertising, intended
to seduce away happy cockneys of the town&mdash;men
supremely contented with their attics, their
promenades in Fifth Avenue, their visits to
Central Park, where all is arranged for them
without their labor or concern, their evenings
at the music gardens, their soft morning slumbers,
which know no dreadful chills and dews!
How could a back-ache over the pea-bed compensate
for these felicities? How could sour
cherries, or half-ripe strawberries, or wet rosebuds,
even if they do come from one's own garden,
reward him for the lose of the ease and
the serene conscience of one who sings merrily
in the streets, and cares not whether worms
burrow, whether suns burn, whether birds steal,
whether winds overturn, whether droughts
destroy, whether floods drown, whether gardens
flourish, or not?&quot;&mdash;<i>Bachelor Bluff: his Opinions,

<p>I believe that I have found, if not
original sin, at least vegetable total depravity
in my garden; and it was there before
I went into it. It is the bunch-, or joint-, or
snake-grass,&mdash;whatever it is called. As I do
not know the names of all the weeds and plants,
I have to do as Adam did in his garden,&mdash;name
things as I find them. This grass has a slender,
beautiful stalk: and when you cut it down, or
pull up a long root of it, you fancy it is got rid
of; but in a day or two it will come up in the
same spot in half a dozen vigorous blades.
Cutting down and pulling up is what it thrives
on. Extermination rather helps it. If you
follow a slender white root, it will be found to
run under the ground until it meets another
slender white root; and you will soon unearth
a network of them, with a knot somewhere,
sending out dozens of sharp-pointed, healthy
shoots, every joint prepared to be an independent
life and plant. The only way to deal with
it is to take one part hoe and two parts fingers,
and carefully dig it out, not leaving a joint anywhere.
It will take a little time, say all summer,
to dig out thoroughly a small patch; but
if you once dig it out, and keep it out, you will
have no further trouble.</p>

<p>I have said it was total depravity. Here it
is. If you attempt to pull up and root out sin
in you, which shows on the surface,&mdash;if it does
not show, you do not care for it,&mdash;you may
have noticed how it runs into an interior network
of sins, and an ever-sprouting branch of
these roots somewhere; and that you cannot
pull out one without making a general internal
disturbance, and rooting up your whole being.
I suppose it is less trouble to quietly cut them
off at the top&mdash;say once a week, on Sunday,
when you put on your religious clothes and
face,&mdash;so that no one will see them, and not try
to eradicate the network within.</p>

<p><i>Remark</i>.&mdash;This moral vegetable figure is at
the service of any clergyman who will have the
manliness to come forward and help me at a
day's hoeing on my potatoes. None but the
orthodox need apply.</p>

<p>I, however, believe in the intellectual, if not
the moral, qualities of vegetables, and especially
weeds. There was a worthless vine that (or
who) started up about midway between a grape-trellis
and a row of bean-poles, some three feet
from each, but a little nearer the trellis. When
it came out of the ground, it looked around to
see what it should do. The trellis was already
occupied. The bean-pole was empty. There was
evidently the a little best chance of light, air,
and sole proprietorship on the pole. And the vine
started for the pole, and began to climb it with
determination. Here was as distinct an act of
choice, of reason, as a boy exercises when he
goes into a forest, and, looking about, decides
which tree he will climb. And, besides, how
did the vine know enough to travel in exactly
the right direction, three feet, to find what it
wanted? This is intellect. The weeds, on the
other hand, have hateful moral qualities. To
cut down a weed is, therefore, to do a moral
action. I feel as if I were destroying a sin.
My hoe becomes an instrument of retributive
justice. I am an apostle of nature. This view
of the matter lends a dignity to the art of hoeing
which nothing else does, and lifts it into
the region of ethics. Hoeing becomes, not a
pastime, but a duty. And you get to regard it
so, as the days and the weeds lengthen.</p>

<p><i>Observation</i>.&mdash;Nevertheless, what a man needs
in gardening is a cast-iron back, with a hinge in
it. The hoe is an ingenious instrument, calculated
to call out a great deal of strength at a
great disadvantage.</p>

<p>The striped bug has come, the saddest of the
year. He is a moral double-ender, iron-clad at
that. He is unpleasant in two ways. He burrows
in the ground so that you cannot find him,
and he flies away so that you cannot catch him.
He is rather handsome, as bugs go, but utterly
dastardly, in that he gnaws the stem of the
plant close to the ground, and ruins it without
any apparent advantage to himself. I find him
on the hills of cucumbers (perhaps it will be a
cholera-year, and we shall not want any), the
squashes (small loss), and the melons (which
never ripen). The best way to deal with the
striped bug is to sit down by the hills, and
patiently watch for him. If you are spry, you
can annoy him. This, however, takes time. It
takes all day and part of the night. For he
flieth in the darkness, and wasteth at noonday.
If you get up before the dew is off the plants,&mdash;it
goes off very early,&mdash;you can sprinkle soot on
the plant (soot is my panacea: if I can get the
disease of a plant reduced to the necessity of
soot, I am all right); and soot is unpleasant to
the bug. But the best thing to do is set a toad
to catch the bugs. The toad at once establishes
the most intimate relations with the bug. It is
a pleasure to see such unity among the lower
animals. The difficulty is to make the toad
stay and watch the hill. If you know your
toad, it is all right. If you do not, you must
build a tight fence round the plants, which the
toad cannot jump over. This, however, introduces
a new element. I find that I have a
zoological garden on my hands. It is an unexpected
result of my little enterprise, which
never aspired to the completeness of the Paris
&quot;Jardin des Plantes.&quot;&mdash;<i>My Summer in a
Garden</i>.</p>


<h2>THE PLUMBER.</h2>

<p>Speaking of the philosophical temper, there
is no class of men whose society is to be more
desired for this quality than that of plumbers!
They are the most agreeable men I know; and
the boys in the business begin to be agreeable
very early. I suspect the secret of it is, that
they are agreeable by the hour. In the driest
days, my fountain became disabled: the pipe
was stopped up. A couple of plumbers, with
the implements of their craft, came out to view
the situation. There was a good deal of difference
of opinion about where the stoppage was.
I found the plumbers perfectly willing to sit
down and talk about it,&mdash;talk by the hour.
Some of their guesses and remarks were exceedingly
ingenious; and their general observations
on other subjects were excellent in their
way, and could hardly have been better if they
had been made by the job. The work dragged
a little,&mdash;as it is apt to do by the hour. The
plumbers had occasion to make me several
visits. Sometimes they would find, upon arrival,
that they had forgotten some indispensable
tool; and one would go back to the shop,
a mile and a half, after it; and his comrade
would await his return with the most exemplary
patience, and sit down and talk,&mdash;always by the
hour. I do not know but it is a habit to have
something wanted at the shop. They seemed
to me very good workmen, and always willing
to stop and talk about the job, or any thing
else, when I went near them. Nor had they
any of that impetuous hurry that is said to be
the bane of our American civilization. To their
credit be it said, that I never observed any
thing of it in them. They can afford to wait.
Two of them will sometimes wait nearly half
a day while a comrade goes for a tool. They
are patient and philosophical. It is a great
pleasure to meet such men. One only wishes
there was some work he could do for <i>them</i> by
the hour. There ought to be reciprocity. I
think they have very nearly solved the problem
of Life: it is to work for other people,
never for yourself, and get your pay by the
hour. You then have no anxiety, and little
work. If you do things by the job, you are
perpetually driven: the hours are scourges. If
you work by the hour, you gently sail on the
stream of Time, which is always bearing you
on to the haven of Pay, whether you make any
effort or not. Working by the hour tends to
make one moral. A plumber working by the
job, trying to unscrew a rusty, refractory nut,
in a cramped position, where the tongs continually
slipped off, would swear; but I never heard
one of them swear, or exhibit the least impatience
at such a vexation, working by the hour.
Nothing can move a man who is paid by the
hour. How sweet the flight of time seems to his
calm mind!&mdash;<i>My Summer in a Garden</i>.</p>

<p>An old red house on a rocky shore, with a
fisherman's blue boat rocking on the
bay, and two white sails glistening far away
over the water. Above, the blue, shining sky;
and below, the blue shining sea.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems clever to have a pleasant day,&quot;
said Mrs. Davids, sighing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davids said every thing with a sigh, and
now she wiped her eyes also on her calico apron.
She was a woman with a complexion like faded
sea-weed, who seemed always pitying herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I tell them,&quot; said she, &quot;I have had real hard
luck. My husband is buried away off in California,
and my son died in the army, and he is
buried away down South. Neither one of them
is buried together.&quot;</p>

<p>Then she sighed again. Twice, this time.</p>

<p>&quot;And so,&quot; she continued, taking out a pinch
of bayberry snuff, &quot;I am left alone in the world.
<i>Alone</i>, I say! why, I've got a daughter, but she
is away out West. She is married to an engineer-man.
And I've got two grandchildren.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Davids took the pinch of bayberry and
shook her head, looking as though that was the
&quot;hardest luck&quot; of all.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, everybody has to have their pesters,
and you'll have to take yours,&quot; rejoined Miss
Persis Tame, taking a pinch of snuff&mdash;the real
Maccaboy&mdash;twice as large, with twice as fierce
an action. &quot;I don't know what it is to bury
children, nor to lose a husband; I s'pose I
don't; but I know what it is to be jammed
round the world and not have a ruff to stick
my head under. I wish I had all the money
I ever spent travelling,&mdash;and <i>that's</i> twelve dollars,&quot;
she continued, regretfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Why in the world don't you marry and have
a home of your own,&quot; sighed Mrs. Davids.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't <i>expect</i> to marry. I don't know
as I do at my time of life,&quot; responded the spinster.
&quot;I rather guess my day for chances is
gone by.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ain't such a dreadful sight older than
I am, though,&quot; replied Mrs. Davids, reflectively.</p>

<p>&quot;Not so old by two full years,&quot; returned
Miss Tame, taking another smart pinch of
snuff, as though it touched the empty spot in
her heart and did it good. &quot;But <i>you</i> ain't looking
out for opportunities yet, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Davids sighed, evasively. &quot;We can't
tell what is before us. There is more than
one man in want of a wife.&quot;</p>

<p>As though to point her words, Captain Ben
Lundy came in sight on the beach, his head
a long way forward and his shambling feet trying
in vain to keep up.</p>

<p>&quot;Thirteen months and a half since Lyddy
was buried,&quot; continued Mrs. Davids, accepting
this application to her words, &quot;and there is
Captain Ben taking up with just what housekeeper
he can get, and <i>no</i> housekeeper at all.
It would be an excellent home for you, Persis.
Captain Ben always had the name of making a
kind husband.&quot;</p>

<p>She sighed again, whether from regret for
the bereaved man, or for the multitude of
women bereft of such a husband.</p>

<p>By this time Captain Ben's head was at the
door.</p>

<p>&quot;Morning!&quot; said he, while his feet were coming
up. &quot;Quite an accident down here below
the lighthouse last night. Schooner ran ashore
in the blow and broke all up into kindling-wood
in less than no time. Captain Tisdale's been
out looking for dead bodies ever since daylight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knowed it,&quot; sighed Mrs. Davids. &quot;I
heard a rushing sound sometime about the
break of day that waked me out of a sound
sleep, and I knowed then there was a spirit
leaving its body. I heard it the night Davids
went, or I expect I did. It must have been
very nearly at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess it wasn't a spirit, last night,&quot;
said Captain Ben; &quot;for as I was going on to
say, after searching back and forth, Captain
Tisdale came upon the folks, a man and a boy,
rolled up in their wet blankets asleep behind
the life-boat house. He said he felt like he
could shake them for staying out in the wet.
Wrecks always make for the lighthouse, so he
s'posed those ones were drowned to death, sure
enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, then it couldn't have been them, I
was warned of!&quot; returned Mrs. Davids, looking
as though she regretted it. &quot;It was right over
my head, and I waked up just as the thing was
rushing past. You haven't heard, have you,&quot;
she continued, &quot;whether or no there was any
other damage done by the gale?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know whether you would call it
damage exactly,&quot; returned Captain Ben; &quot;but
Loizah Mullers got so scared she left me and
went home. She said she couldn't stay and
run the chance of another of our coast blows,
and off she trapsed.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Davids sighed like November. &quot;So
you have some hard luck as well as myself. I
don't suppose you can <i>get</i> a housekeeper to
keep her long,&quot; said she, dismally.</p>

<p>&quot;Abel Grimes tells me it is enough sight
easier getting wives than housekeepers, and
I'm some of a mind to try that tack,&quot; replied
Captain Ben, smiling grimly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davids put up her hand to feel of her
back hair, and smoothed down her apron;
while Miss Persis Tame blushed like a withered
rose, and turned her eyes modestly out of
the window.</p>

<p>&quot;I am <i>so</i>. But the difficulty is, who will it
be? There are so many to select from it is
fairly bothersome,&quot; continued Captain Ben,
winking fast and looking as though he was
made of dry corncobs and hay.</p>

<p>Miss Persis Tame turned about abruptly.
&quot;The land alive!&quot; she ejaculated with such
sudden emphasis that the dishes shook on their
shelves and Captain Ben in his chair. &quot;It
makes me mad as a March hare to hear men
go on as though all they'd got to do was to
throw down their handkerchers to a woman,
and, no matter who, she'd spring and run to
pick it up. It is always 'Who will I marry?'
and not 'Who will marry me?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, there is twice the number of widders
that there is of widderers here at the P'int.
That was what was in my mind,&quot; said Captain
Ben, in a tone of meek apology. &quot;There is
the Widow Keens, she that was Azubah Muchmore.
I don't know but what she would do;
Lyddy used to think every thing of her, and
she is a first-rate of a housekeeper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps so,&quot; assented Mrs. Davids, dubiously.
&quot;But she is troubled a sight with the
head complaint; I suppose you know she is.
That is against her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; assented Miss Tame. &quot;The Muchmores
all have weak heads. And, too, the
Widow Keens, she's had a fall lately. She
was up in a chair cleaning her top buttery shelf,
and somehow one of the chair-leg's give way,&mdash;it
was loose or something, I expect,&mdash;and down
she went her whole heft. She keeps about,
but she goes with two staves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to know if that is so,&quot; said Captain
Ben, his honest soul warming with sudden
sympathy. &quot;The widder has seen a sight of
trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she has lived through a good deal,
that woman has. I couldn't live through so
much, 'pears to me; but we don't know what
we can live through,&quot; rejoined Miss Tame.</p>

<p>Captain Ben did not reply, but his ready feet
began to move to and fro restlessly; for his
heart, more ready yet, had already gone out
toward the unfortunate widow.</p>

<p>&quot;It is so bad for a woman to be alone,&quot;
said he to himself, shambling along the shingly
beach a moment after. &quot;Nobody to mend her
chairs or split up her kindlings, or do a chore
for her; and she lame into the bargain. It is
<i>too</i> bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has steered straight for the Widow
Keens's, as sure as A is apple-dumpling,&quot; remarked
Miss Persis, peering after him from the
window.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I must admit I wouldn't have
thought of Captain Ben's being en-a-mored
after such a sickly piece of business. But men
never know what they want. Won't you just
hand me that gum-cam-phyer bottle, now you
are up? It is on that chest of drawers behind
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No more they don't,&quot; returned Miss Tame,
with a plaintive cadence, taking a sniff from
the camphor-bottle on the way. &quot;However, I
don't begrutch him to her,&mdash;I don't know as I
do. It will make her a good hum, though, if
she concludes to make arrangements.&quot;</p>

<p>Meantime, Captain Ben Lundy's head was
wellnigh to Mrs. Keens's door, for it was situated
only around the first sand-hill. She lived
in a little bit of a house that looked as though
it had been knocked together for a crockery-crate,
in the first place, with two windows and
a rude door thrown in as afterthoughts. In the
rear of this house was another tiny building,
something like a grown-up hen-coop; and this
was where Mrs. Keens carried on the business
bequeathed to her by her deceased husband,
along with five small children, and one not so
small. But, worse than that, one who was
&quot;not altogether there,&quot; as the English say.</p>

<p>She was about this business now, dressed in
a primitive sort of bloomer, with a wash-tub
and clothes-ringer before her, and an army of
bathing-suits of every kind and color flapping
wildly in the fresh sea air at one side.</p>

<p>From a little farther on, mingling with the
sound of the beating surf, came the merry
voices of bathers,&mdash;boarders at the great hotels
on the hill.</p>

<p>&quot;Here you be! Hard at it!&quot; said Captain
Ben, puffing around the corner like a portable
west-wind. I've understood you've had a
hurt. Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no! Nothing to mention,&quot; returned
Mrs. Keens, turning about a face bright and
cheerful as the full moon; and throwing, as by
accident, a red bathing-suit over the two broomsticks
that leaned against her tub.</p>

<p>Unlike Mrs. Davids, Mrs. Keens neither
pitied herself nor would allow anybody else to
do so.</p>

<p>&quot;Sho!&quot; remarked Captain Ben, feeling defrauded.
He had counted on sacrificing himself
to his sympathies, but he didn't give up yet.
&quot;You must see some pretty tough times 'pears
to me with such a parcel of little ones, and
only yourself to look to,&quot; said he, proceeding
awkwardly enough to hang the pile of wrung-out
clothes upon an empty line.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't complain,&quot; returned the widow,
bravely. &quot;My children are not <i>teusome</i>; and
Jack, why you would be surprised to see how
many things Jack can do, for all he isn't quite
right.&quot;</p>

<p>As she spoke thus with affectionate pride,
Jack came up wheeling a roughly made cart
filled with wet bathing clothes from the beach.
He looked up at sound of his mother's voice
with something of the dumb tenderness of an
intelligent dog. &quot;Jack helps, Jack good boy,&quot;
said he, nodding with a happy smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Jack helps. We don't complain,&quot; repeated
the mother.</p>

<p>&quot;It would come handy, though, to have a
man around to see to things and kind o' provide,
wouldn't it, though?&quot; persisted Captain
Ben.</p>

<p>&quot;Some might think so,&quot; replied Mrs. Keens,
stopping her wringer to reflect a little. &quot;But
I haven't any wish to change my situation,&quot;
she added, decidedly, going on again with her
work.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure on 't?&quot; persisted the Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Certain,&quot; replied the widow.</p>

<p>Captain Ben sighed. &quot;I thought ma'be you
was having a hard row to hoe, and I thought
like enough&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p><i>What</i> he never said, excepting by a beseeching
glance at the cheerful widow, for just then
an interruption came from some people after
bathing-suits.</p>

<p>So Captain Ben moved off with a dismal
countenance. But before he had gone far it
suddenly brightened. &quot;It might not be for
the best,&quot; quoth he to himself, &quot;Like enough
not. I was very careful not to commit myself,
and I am very glad I didn't.&quot; He smiled as he
reflected on his judicious wariness. &quot;But,
however,&quot; he continued, &quot;I might as well finish
up this business now. There is Rachel Doolittle.
Who knows but she'd make a likely wife?
Lyddy sot a good deal by her. She never had
a quilting or a sewing bee but what nothing
would do but she must give Rachel Doolittle
an invite. Yes; I wonder I never decided on
her before. She will be glad of a home sure
enough, for she haves to live around, as it were,
upon her brothers.&quot;</p>

<p>Captain Ben's feet quickened themselves at
these thoughts, and had almost overtaken his
head, when behold! at a sudden turn in the
road there stood Miss Rachel Doolittle, picking
barberries from a wayside bush. &quot;My sakes!
If she ain't right here, like Rachel in the
Bible!&quot; ejaculated Captain Ben, taking heart
at the omen.</p>

<p>Miss Doolittle looked up from under her tied-down
brown hat in surprise at such a salutation.
But her surprise was increased by Captain
Ben's next remark.</p>

<p>&quot;It just came into my mind,&quot; said he, &quot;that
you was the right one to take Lyddy's place.
You two used to be such great knit-ups that it
will seem 'most like having Lyddy back again.
No,&quot; he continued, after a little reflection, &quot;I
don't know of anybody I had rather see sitting
in Lyddy's chair and wearing Lyddy's things
than yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me, Captain Lundy, I couldn't think
of it. Paul's folks expect me to stay with them
while the boarder-season lasts, and I've as good
as promised Jacob's wife I'll spend the winter
with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ain't that a hard life you are laying out for
yourself? And then bum-by you will get old or
sick ma' be, and who is going to want you
around then? Every woman needs a husband
of her own to take care of her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm able to take care of myself as yet,
thanks to goodness! And I am not afraid my
brothers will see me suffer in case of sickness,&quot;
returned Miss Doolittle, her cheeks flaming up
like a sumach in October.</p>

<p>&quot;But hadn't you better take a little time to
think it over? Ma' be it come sudden to you,&quot;
pleaded Captain Ben.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I thank you. Some things don't need
thinking over,&quot; answered Miss Doolittle, plucking
at the barberries more diligently than ever.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish Lyddy was here. She would convince
you you were standing in your own
light,&quot; returned Lyddy's widower in a perplexed
tone.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't need one to come from the dead to
show me my own mind,&quot; retorted Miss Doolittle,
firmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, like enough you are right,&quot; said Captain
Ben, mildly, putting a few stems of barberries
in her pail; &quot;ma' be it wouldn't be
best. I don't want to be rash.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that he moved off, on the whole
congratulating himself he had not decided to
marry Miss Doolittle.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought after she commenced her miserable
gift of the gab, that Lyddy used to be
free to admit she had a fiery tongue, for all
they were such friends. And I'm all for peace
myself. I guess, on the whole, ma' be she ain't
the one for me, perhaps, and it is as well to look
further. <i>Why</i>! what in <i>the</i> world! Well, there!
what have I been thinking of? There is Mrs.
Davids, as neat as a new cent, and the master
hand to save. She is always taking on; and
she will be glad enough to have somebody to
look out for her,&mdash;why, sure enough! And
there I was right at her house this very day,
and never once thought of her! What an old
dunce!&quot;</p>

<p>But, fortunately, this not being a sin of
commission, it could easily be rectified; and
directly Captain Ben had turned about and
was trotting again toward the red house on
the beach.</p>

<p>&quot;Pound for pound of the best white sugar,&quot;
he heard Miss Tame say as he neared the door.</p>

<p>&quot;White, sugar!&quot; repeated Mrs. Davids, her
usual sigh drawn out into a little groan. &quot;<i>White</i>
sugar for <i>cram</i> berries! Who ever heard of such
a thing? I've always considered I did well
when I had plenty of brown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor creeter!&quot; thought Captain Ben.
&quot;How she will enjoy getting into my pantry.
Lyddy never complained that she didn't have
enough of every thing to do <i>with</i>&quot;</p>

<p>And in the full ardor of his intended benevolence,
he went right in and opened the subject
at once. But, to his astonishment, Mrs. Davids
refused him. She sighed, but she refused him.</p>

<p>&quot;I've seen trouble enough a'ready, without
my rushing into more with my eyes wide open,&quot;
sighed she.</p>

<p>&quot;Trouble? Why, that is just what I was
meaning to save you!&quot; exclaimed the bewildered
widower. &quot;Pump right in the house,
and stove e'enamost new. And Lyddy never
knew what it was to want for a spoonful of
sugar or a pound of flour. And such a <i>handy</i>
buttery and sink! Lyddy used to say she felt
the worst about leaving her buttery of any
thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Should thought she would,&quot; answered Mrs.
Davids, forgetting to sigh. &quot;However, I can't
say that I feel any hankering after marrying a
buttery. I've got buttery-room enough here,
without the trouble of getting set up in a new
place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just as you say,&quot; returned the rejected. &quot;I
ain't sure as you'd be exactly the one. I <i>was</i>
a thinking of looking for somebody a little
younger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, here is Persis Tame. Why don't you
bespeak her? <i>She</i> is younger, and she is in
need of a good home. I can recommend her,
too, as the first-rate of a cook,&quot; remarked Mrs.
Davids, benevolently.</p>

<p>Miss Tame had been sitting a little apart by
the open window, smiling to herself.</p>

<p>But now she turned about at once. &quot;Hm!&quot;
said she, with contempt. &quot;I should rather live
under an umbrella tied to a stake, than marry
for a <i>hum</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>So Captain Ben went home without engaging
either wife or housekeeper.</p>

<p>And the first thing he saw was Captain Jacob
Doolittle's old one-eyed horse eating the apples
Loizah Mullers had strung and festooned from
nails against the house, to dry.</p>

<p>The next thing he saw was, that, having left
a window open, the hens had flown in and gone
to housekeeping on their own account. But
they were not, like Mrs. Davids, as neat as a
new cent, and <i>not</i>, also, such master hands to
save.</p>

<p>&quot;Shoo! shoo! Get out. Go 'long there
with you!&quot; cried Captain Ben, waving the
dish-cloth and the poker. &quot;I declare for 't!
I most hadn't ought to have left that bread
out on the table. They've made a pretty
mess of it, and it is every spec there is in the
house too. Well, I must make a do of potatoes
for supper, with a bit of pie and a mouthful
of cake.&quot;</p>

<p>Accordingly he went to work building a fire
that wouldn't burn. Then, forgetting the simple
matter of dampers, the potatoes wouldn't
bake. The tea-kettle boiled over and cracked
the stove, and after that boiled dry and cracked
itself. Finally the potatoes fell to baking with
so much ardor that they overdid it and burnt
up. And, last of all, the cake-jar and pie-cupboard
proved to be entirely empty. Loizah had
left on the eve of baking-day.</p>

<p>&quot;The old cat! Well, I'd just as soon live
on slapjacks a spell,&quot; said Captain Ben, when he
made this discovery.</p>

<p>But even slapjacks palled on his palate, especially
when he had them always to cook for
himself.</p>

<p>&quot;'T ain't no way to live, this ain't,&quot; said he
at last. &quot;I'm a good mind to marry as ever
I had to eat.&quot;</p>

<p>So he put on his hat and walked out. The
first person he met was Miss Persis Tame, who
turned her back and fell to picking thoroughwort
blossoms as he came up.</p>

<p>&quot;Look a here,&quot; said he, stopping short, &quot;I'm
dreadful put to 't. I can't get ne'er a wife nor
ne'er a housekeeper, and I am e'enamost starved
to death. I wish you <i>would</i> consent to marry
with me, if you feel as if you could bring
your mind to it. I am sure it would have been
Lyddy's wish.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Tame smelt of the thoroughwort blossoms.</p>

<p>&quot;It comes pretty sudden on me,&quot; she replied.
&quot;I hadn't given the subject any thought. But
you <i>are</i> to be pitied in your situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. And I'm dreadful lonesome. I've
always been used to having Lyddy to talk over
things with, and I miss her a sight. And I
don't know anybody that has her ways more
than you have. You are a good deal such
a built woman, and you have the same hitch to
your shoulders when you walk. You've got
something the same look to your eyes, too; I
noticed it last Sunday in meeting-time,&quot; continued
the widower, anxiously.</p>

<p>&quot;I do feel for you. A man alone is in a deplorable
situation,&quot; replied Miss Tame. &quot;I'm
sure I'd do any thing in my power to help
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, marry with me then. That is what I
want. We could be real comfortable together.
I'll go for the license this minute, and we'll
be married right away,&quot; returned the impatient
suitor. &quot;You go up to Elder Crane's, and I'll
meet you there as soon as I can fetch around.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he hurried away, &quot;without giving me a
chance to say 'no,'&quot; said &quot;she that was&quot; Persis
Tame, afterward. &quot;So I <i>had</i> to marry with him,
as you might say. But I've never seen cause
to regret it, I've got a first-rate of a hum,
and Captain Ben makes a first-rate of a husband.
And no hain't he, I hope, found cause
to regret it,&quot; she added, with a touch of wifely
pride; &quot;though I do expect he might have had
his pick among all the single women at the
Point; but out of them all he chose <i>me</i>.&quot;&mdash;<i>The
Atlantic Monthly</i>, March, 1870.</p>

<p>The mules were my especial delight; and
an hour's study of a constant succession
of them introduced me to many of their characteristics;
for six of these odd little beasts
drew each army wagon, and went hopping like
frogs through the stream of mud that gently
rolled along the street. The coquettish mule
had small feet, a nicely trimmed tassel of a tail,
perked-up ears, and seemed much given to little
tosses of the head, affected skips and prances;
and, if he wore the bells, or were bedizened
with a bit of finery, put on as many airs as any
belle. The moral mule was a stout, hardworking
creature, always tugging with all his
might; often pulling away after the rest had
stopped, laboring under the conscientious delusion
that food for the entire army depended
upon his private exertions. I respected this
style of mule; and, had I possessed a juicy cabbage,
would have pressed it upon him, with
thanks for his excellent example. The histrionic
mule was a melodramatic quadruped, prone to
startling humanity by erratic leaps, and wild
plunges, much shaking of his stubborn head,
and lashing out of his vicious heels; now and
then falling flat, and apparently dying <i>a la</i>
Forrest; a gasp&mdash;a squirm&mdash;a flop, and so on,
till the street was well blocked up, the drivers
all swearing like demons in bad hats, and the
chief actor's circulation decidedly quickened by
every variety of kick, cuff, jerk, and haul.
When the last breath seemed to have left his
body, and &quot;doctors were in vain,&quot; a sudden
resurrection took place; and if ever a mule
laughed with scornful triumph, that was the
beast, as he leisurely rose, gave a comfortable
shake, and, calmly regarding the excited crowd
seemed to say&mdash;&quot;A hit! a decided hit! for the
stupidest of animals has bamboozled a dozen
men. Now, then! what are <i>you</i> stopping the
way for?&quot; The pathetic mule was, perhaps,
the most interesting of all; for, though he
always seemed to be the smallest, thinnest,
weakest of the six, the postillion, with big
boots, long-tailed coat, and heavy whip, was
sure to bestride this one, who struggled feebly
along, head down, coat muddy and rough, eye
spiritless and sad, his very tail a mortified
stump, and the whole beast a picture of meek
misery, fit to touch a heart of stone. The
jovial mule was a roly poly, happy-go-lucky
little piece of horse-flesh, taking every thing
easily, from cudgeling to caressing; strolling
along with a roguish twinkle of the eye, and, if
the thing were possible, would have had his
hands in his pockets, and whistled as he went.
If there ever chanced to be an apple core, a
stray turnip, or wisp of hay, in the gutter, this
Mark Tapley was sure to find it, and none of
his mates seemed to begrudge him his bite.
I suspected this fellow was the peacemaker,
confidant, and friend of all the others, for he
had a sort of &quot;Cheer-up,-old-boy,-I'll-pull-you-through&quot;
look, which was exceedingly engaging.</p>

<p>Pigs also possessed attractions for me, never
having had an opportunity of observing their
graces of mind and manner, till I came to
Washington, whose porcine citizens appeared
to enjoy a larger liberty than many of its
human ones. Stout, sedate-looking pigs, hurried
by each morning to their places of business,
with a preoccupied air, and sonorous
greeting to their friends. Genteel pigs, with
an extra curl to their tails, promenaded in pairs,
lunching here and there, like gentlemen of
leisure. Rowdy pigs pushed the passers-by off
the sidewalk; tipsy pigs hiccoughed their version
of &quot;We won't go home till morning,&quot; from
the gutter; and delicate young pigs tripped
daintily through the mud, as if they plumed
themselves upon their ankles, and kept themselves
particularly neat in point of stockings.
Maternal pigs, with their interesting families,
strolled by in the sun; and often the pink,
baby-like squealers lay down for a nap, with a
trust in Providence worthy of human imitation.&mdash;<i>Hospital

<h2><a name="SELECTIONS_FROM_TRANSCENDENTAL_WILD_OATS" id="SELECTIONS_FROM_TRANSCENDENTAL_WILD_OATS"></a>SELECTIONS FROM TRANSCENDENTAL WILD OATS.</h2>

<p>On the first day of June, 184-, a large wagon,
drawn by a small horse, and containing a motley
load, went lumbering over certain New England
hills, with the pleasing accompaniments of
wind, rain, and hail. A serene man with a
serene child upon his knee was driving, or
rather being driven, for the small horse had it
all his own way. A brown boy with a William
Penn style of countenance sat beside him,
firmly embracing a bust of Socrates. Behind
them was an energetic-looking woman, with a
benevolent brow, satirical mouth, and eyes
brimful of hope and courage. A baby reposed
upon her lap, a mirror leaned against her knee,
and a basket of provisions danced about at her
feet, as she struggled with a large, unruly umbrella.
Two blue-eyed little girls, with hands
full of childish treasures, sat under one old
shawl, chatting happily together.</p>

<p>In front of this lively party stalked a tall,
sharp-featured man, in a long blue cloak; and a
fourth small girl trudged along beside him
through the mud as if she rather enjoyed it.</p>

<p>The wind whistled over the bleak hills; the
rain fell in a despondent drizzle, and twilight
began to fall. But the calm man gazed as
tranquilly into the fog as if he beheld a radiant
bow of promise spanning the gray sky. The
cheery woman tried to cover every one but herself
with the big umbrella. The brown boy
pillowed his head on the bald pate of Socrates
and slumbered peacefully. The little girls sang
lullabies to their dolls in soft, maternal murmers.
The sharp-nosed pedestrian marched steadily
on, with the blue cloak streaming out behind him
like a banner; and the lively infant splashed
through the puddles with a duck-like satisfaction
pleasant to behold.</p>

<p>Thus these modern pilgrims journeyed hopefully
out of the old world, to found a new one
in the wilderness.</p>

<p>The editors of &quot;The Transcendental Tripod&quot;
had received from Messrs. Lion &amp; Lamb (two
of the aforesaid pilgrims) a communication
from which the following statement is an extract:</p>

<p>&quot;We have made arrangements with the proprietor
of an estate of about a hundred acres
which liberates this tract from human ownership.
Here we shall prosecute our effort to
initiate a Family in harmony with the primitive
instincts of man.</p>

<p>&quot;Ordinary secular farming is not our object.
Fruit, grain, pulse, herbs, flax, and other vegetable
products, receiving assiduous attention,
will afford ample manual occupation, and
chaste supplies for the bodily needs. It is intended
to adorn the pastures with orchards,
and to supersede the labor of cattle by the
spade and the pruning-knife.</p>

<p>&quot;Consecrated to human freedom, the land
awaits the sober culture of devoted men. Beginning
with small pecuniary means, this enterprise
must be rooted on a reliance on the succors
of an over-bounteous Providence, whose
vital affinities being secured by this union with
uncorrupted field and unwordly persons, the
cares and injuries of a life of gain are avoided.</p>

<p>&quot;The inner nature of each member of the
Family is at no time neglected. Our plan contemplates
all such disciplines, cultures, and
habits as evidently conduce to the purifying
of the inmates.</p>

<p>&quot;Pledged to the spirit alone, the founders
anticipate no hasty or numerous addition to
their numbers. The kingdom of peace is entered
only through the gates of self-denial; and
felicity is the test and the reward of loyalty to
the unswerving law of Love.&quot;</p>

<p>This prospective Eden at present consisted of
an old red farm-house, a dilapidated barn, many
acres of meadow-land, and a grove. Ten ancient
apple-trees were all the &quot;chaste supply&quot; which
the place offered as yet; but, in the firm belief
that plenteous orchards were soon to be evoked
from their inner consciousness, these sanguine
founders had christened their domain Fruitlands.</p>

<p>Here Timon Lion intended to found a colony
of Latter Day Saints, who, under his patriarchal
sway, should regenerate the world and glorify
his name for ever. Here Abel Lamb, with the
devoutest faith in the high ideal which was to
him a living truth, desired to plant a Paradise,
where Beauty, Virtue, Justice, and Love might
live happily together, without the possibility of
a serpent entering in. And here his wife, unconverted
but faithful to the end, hoped, after
many wanderings over the face of the earth,
to find rest for herself and a home for her
children.</p>

<p>&quot;There is our new abode,&quot; anounced the
enthusiast, smiling with the satisfaction quite
undamped by the drops dripping from his
hat-brim, as they turned at length into a cart-path
that wound along a steep hillside into a
barren-looking valley.</p>

<p>&quot;A little difficult of access,&quot; observed his
practical wife, as she endeavored to keep her
various household gods from going overboard
with every lurch of the laden ark.</p>

<p>&quot;Like all good things. But those who earnestly
desire and patiently seek will soon find
us,&quot; placidly responded the philosopher from
the mud, through which he was now endeavoring
to pilot the much-enduring horse.</p>

<p>&quot;Truth lies at the bottom of a well, Sister
Hope,&quot; said Brother Timon, pausing to detach
his small comrade from a gate, whereon she was
perched for a clearer gaze into futurity.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the reason we so seldom get at it, I
suppose,&quot; replied Mrs. Hope, making a vain
clutch at the mirror, which a sudden jolt sent
flying out of her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;We want no false reflections here,&quot; said
Timon, with a grim smile, as he crunched the
fragments under foot in his onward march.</p>

<p>Sister Hope held her peace, and looked wistfully
through the mist at her promised home.
The old red house with a hospitable glimmer at
its windows cheered her eyes; and, considering
the weather, was a fitter refuge than the sylvan
bowers some of the more ardent souls might
have preferred.</p>

<p>The new-comers were welcomed by one of
the elect precious,&mdash;a regenerate farmer, whose
idea of reform consisted chiefly in wearing white
cotton raiment and shoes of untanned leather.
This costume, with a snowy beard, gave him a
venerable, and at the same time a somewhat
bridal appearance.</p>

<p>The goods and chattels of the Society not
having arrived, the weary family reposed before
the fire on blocks of wood, while Brother
Moses White regaled them with roasted potatoes,
brown bread and water, in two plates,
a tin pan, and one mug; his table service being
limited. But, having cast the forms and vanities
of a depraved world behind them, the elders
welcomed hardship with the enthusiasm of
new pioneers, and the children heartily enjoyed
this foretaste of what they believed was to be a
sort of perpetual picnic.</p>

<p>During the progress of this frugal meal, two
more brothers appeared. One a dark, melancholy
man, clad in homespun, whose peculiar
mission was to turn his name hind part before
and use as few words as possible. The other
was a bland, bearded Englishman, who expected
to be saved by eating uncooked food
and going without clothes. He had not yet
adopted the primitive costume, however; but
contented himself with meditatively chewing
dry beans out of a basket.</p>

<p>&quot;Every meal should be a sacrament, and the
vessels used should be beautiful and symbolical,&quot;
observed Brother Lamb, mildly, righting
the tin pan slipping about on his knees. &quot;I
priced a silver service when in town, but it was
too costly; so I got some graceful cups and
vases of Britannia ware.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hardest things in the world to keep bright.
Will whiting be allowed in the community?&quot;
inquired Sister Hope, with a housewife's interest
in labor-saving institutions.</p>

<p>&quot;Such trivial questions will be discussed at a
more fitting time,&quot; answered Brother Timon,
sharply, as he burnt his fingers with a very hot
potato. &quot;Neither sugar, molasses, milk, butter,
cheese, nor flesh are to be used among us,
for nothing is to be admitted which has caused
wrong or death to man or beast.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our garments are to be linen till we learn
to raise our own cotton or some substitute for
woollen fabrics,&quot; added Brother Abel, blissfully
basking in an imaginary future as warm and
brilliant as the generous fire before him.</p>

<p>&quot;Haou abaout shoes?&quot; asked Brother Moses,
surveying his own with interest.</p>

<p>&quot;We must yield that point till we can
manufacture an innocent substitute for leather.
Bark, wood, or some durable fabric will be invented
in time. Meanwhile, those who desire
to carry out our idea to the fullest extent can
go barefooted,&quot; said Lion, who liked extreme
measures.</p>

<p>&quot;I never will, nor let my girls,&quot; murmured
rebellious Sister Hope, under her breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Haou do you cattle'ate to treat the ten-acre
lot? Ef things ain't 'tended to right
smart, we sha'n't hev no crops,&quot; observed the
practical patriarch in cotton.</p>

<p>&quot;We shall spade it,&quot; replied Abel, in such
perfect good faith that Moses said no more,
though he indulged in a shake of the head as he
glanced at hands that held nothing heavier than
a pen for years. He was a paternal old soul
and regarded the younger men as promising
boys on a new sort of lark.</p>

<p>&quot;What shall we do for lamps, if we cannot
use any animal substance? I do hope light of
some sort is to be thrown upon the enterprise,&quot;
said Mrs. Lamb, with anxiety, for in those days
kerosene and camphene were not, and gas was
unknown in the wilderness.</p>

<p>&quot;We shall go without till we have discovered
some vegetable oil or wax to serve us,&quot; replied
Brother Timon, in a decided tone, which caused
Sister Hope to resolve that her private lamp
should be always trimmed, if not burning.</p>

<p>&quot;Each member is to perform the work for
which experience, strength, and taste best fit
him,&quot; continued Dictator Lion. &quot;Thus drudgery
and disorder will be avoided and harmony
prevail. We shall rise at dawn, begin the day
by bathing, followed by music, and then a
chaste repast of fruit and bread. Each one
finds congenial occupation till the meridian
meal; when some deep-searching conversation
gives rest to the body, and development to the
mind. Healthful labor again engages us till
the last meal, when we assemble in social communion,
prolonged till sunset, when we retire
to sweet repose, ready for the next day's
activity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What part of the work do you incline to
yourself?&quot; asked Sister Hope, with a humorous
glimmer in her keen eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall wait till it is made clear to me.
Being in preference to doing is the great aim,
and this comes to us rather by a resigned willingness
than a wilful activity, which is a
check to all divine growth,&quot; responded Brother
Timon.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; and Mrs. Lamb sighed
audibly, for during the year he had spent in her
family, Brother Timon had so faithfully carried
out his idea of &quot;being, not doing,&quot; that she
had found his &quot;divine growth&quot; both an expensive
and unsatisfactory process.</p>

<p>Here her husband struck into the conversation,
his face shining with the light and joy of
the splendid dreams and high ideals hovering
before him.</p>

<p>&quot;In these steps of reform, we do not rely so
much on scientific reasoning or physiological
skill as on the spirit's dictates. The greater
part of man's duty consists in leaving alone
much that he now does. Shall I stimulate with
tea, coffee, or wine? No. Shall I consume
flesh? Not if I value health. Shall I subjugate
cattle? Shall I claim property in any created
thing? Shall I trade? Shall I adopt a
form of religion? Shall I interest myself in
politics? To how many of these questions&mdash;could
we ask them deeply enough and could
they be heard as having relation to our eternal
welfare&mdash;would the response be 'Abstain'?&quot;</p>

<p>A mild snore seemed to echo the last word
of Abel's rhapsody, for Brother Moses had succumbed
to mundane slumber, and sat nodding
like a massive ghost. Forest Absalom, the
silent man, and John Pease, the English member,
now departed to the barn; and Mrs. Lamb
led her flock to a temporary fold, leaving the
founders of the &quot;Consociate Family&quot; to build
castles in the air till the fire went out and the
symposium ended in smoke.</p>

<p>The furniture arrived next day, and was soon
bestowed; for the principal property of the
community consisted in books. To this rare
library was devoted the best room in the house,
and the few busts and pictures that still survived
many flittings were added to beautify
the sanctuary, for here the family was to meet
for amusement, instruction, and worship.</p>

<p>Any housewife can imagine the emotions of
Sister Hope, when she took possession of a
large, dilapidated kitchen, containing an old
stove and the peculiar stores out of which food
was to be evolved for her little family of eleven.
Cakes of maple sugar, dried peas and beans,
barley and hominy, meal of all sorts, potatoes,
and dried fruit. No milk, butter, cheese, tea,
or meat appeared. Even salt was considered a
useless luxury, and spice entirely forbidden by
these lovers of Spartan simplicity. A ten years'
experience of vegetarian vagaries had been
good training for this new freak, and her sense
of the ludicrous supported her through many
trying scenes.</p>

<p>Unleavened bread, porridge, and water for
breakfast; bread, vegetables, and water for
dinner; bread, fruit, and water for supper was
the bill of fare ordained by the elders. No teapot
profaned that sacred stove, no gory steak
cried aloud for vengeance from her chaste gridiron
and only a brave woman's taste, time,
and temper were sacrificed on that domestic
altar.</p>

<p>The vexed question of light was settled by
buying a quantity of bayberry wax for candles;
and, on discovering that no one knew how to
make them, pine-knots were introduced, to be
used when absolutely necessary. Being summer,
the evenings were not long, and the weary
fraternity found it no great hardship to retire
with the birds. The inner light was sufficient
for most of them. But Mrs. Lamb rebelled.
Evening was the only time she had to herself,
and while the tired feet rested the skilful hands
mended torn frocks and little stockings, or
anxious heart forgot its burden in a book.</p>

<p>So &quot;mother's lamp&quot; burned steadily, while
the philosophers built a new heaven and earth
by moonlight; and through all the metaphysical
mists and philanthropic pyrotechnics
of that period Sister Hope played her own
little game of &quot;throwing light,&quot; and none but
the moths were the worse for it.</p>

<p>Such farming probably was never seen before
since Adam delved. The band of brothers began
by spading garden and field; but a few
days of it lessened their ardor amazingly. Blistered
hands and aching backs suggested the expediency
of permitting the use of cattle till the
workers were better fitted for noble toil by a
summer of the new life.</p>

<p>Brother Moses brought a yoke of oxen from
his farm,&mdash;at least, the philosophers thought so
till it was discovered that one of the animals
was a cow; and Moses confessed that he &quot;must
be let down easy, for he couldn't live on garden
sarse entirely.&quot;</p>

<p>Great was Dictator Lion's indignation at this
lapse from virtue. But time pressed, the work
must be done; so the meek cow was permitted
to wear the yoke, and the recreant brother continued
to enjoy forbidden draughts in the
barn, which dark proceeding caused the children
to regard him as one set apart for destruction.</p>

<p>The sowing was equally peculiar, for, owing
to some mistake, the three brethren who devoted
themselves to this graceful task, found
when about half through the job that each had
been sowing a different sort of grain in the
same field; a mistake which caused much perplexity,
as it could not be remedied; but, after
a long consultation and a good deal of laughter,
it was decided to say nothing and see what
would come of it.</p>

<p>The garden was planted with a generous
supply of useful roots and herbs; but, as
manure was not allowed to profane the virgin
soil, few of these vegetable treasures ever came
up. Purslane reigned supreme, and the disappointed
planters ate it philosophically, deciding
that Nature knew what was best for them, and
would generously supply their needs, if they
could only learn to digest her &quot;sallets&quot; and wild
roots.</p>

<p>The orchard was laid out, a little grafting
done, new trees and vines set, regardless of the
unfit season and entire ignorance of the husbandmen,
who honestly believed that in the
autumn they would reap a bounteous harvest.</p>

<p>Slowly things got into order, and rapidly
rumors of the new experiment went abroad,
causing many strange spirits to flock thither,
for in those days communities were the fashion
and transcendentalism raged wildly. Some
came to look on and laugh, some to be supported
in poetic idleness, a few to believe sincerely
and work heartily. Each member was
allowed to mount his favorite hobby, and ride
it to his heart's content. Very queer were
some of the riders, and very rampant some of
the hobbies.</p>

<p>One youth, believing that language was of
little consequence if the spirit was only right,
startled new-comers by blandly greeting them
with &quot;good-morning, damn you,&quot; and other remarks
of an equally mixed order. A second
irrepressible being held that all the emotions of
the soul should be freely expressed, and illustrated
his theory by antics that would have
sent him to a lunatic asylum, if, as an unregenerate
wag said, he had not already been in one.
When his spirit soared, he climbed trees and
shouted; when doubt assailed him, he lay upon
the floor and groaned lamentably. At joyful
periods, he raced, leaped, and sang; when sad,
he wept aloud; and when a great thought
burst upon him in the watches of the night, he
crowed like a jocund cockerel, to the great delight
of the children and the great annoyance
of the elders. One musical brother fiddled
whenever so moved, sang sentimentally to the
four little girls, and put a music-box on the
wall when he hoed corn.</p>

<p>Brother Pease ground away at his uncooked
food, or browsed over the farm on sorrel, mint,
green fruit, and new vegetables. Occasionally
he took his walks abroad, airily attired in an
unbleached cotton <i>poncho</i>, which was the nearest
approach to the primeval costume he was
allowed to indulge in. At midsummer he retired
to the wilderness, to try his plan where the
woodchucks were without prejudices and huckleberry-bushes
were hospitably full. A sunstroke
unfortunately spoilt his plan, and he returned
to semi-civilization a sadder and wiser
man.</p>

<p>Forest Absalom preserved his Pythagorean
silence, cultivated his fine dark locks, and worked
like a beaver, setting an excellent example
of brotherly love, justice, and fidelity by his upright
life. He it was who helped overworked
Sister Hope with her heavy washes, kneaded
the endless succession of batches of bread,
watched over the children, and did the many
tasks left undone by the brethren, who were
so busy discussing and defining great duties
that they forgot to perform the small ones.</p>

<p>Moses White placidly plodded about, &quot;chorin'
raound,&quot; as he called it, looking like an old-time
patriarch, with his silver hair and flowing beard,
and saving the community from many a mishap
by his thrift and Yankee shrewdness.</p>

<p>Brother Lion domineered over the whole concern;
for, having put the most money into the
speculation, he was resolved to make it pay,&mdash;as
if any thing founded on an ideal basis could
be expected to do so by any but enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Abel Lamb simply revelled in the Newness,
firmly believing that his dream was to be beautifully
realized and in time not only little Fruitlands,
but the whole earth, be turned into a
Happy Valley. He worked with every muscle
of his body, for <i>he</i> was in deadly earnest. He
taught with his whole head and heart; planned
and sacrificed, preached and prophesied, with a
soul full of the purest aspirations, most unselfish
purposes, and desires for a life devoted to God
and man, too high and tender to bear the rough
usage of this world.</p>

<p>It was a little remarkable that only one
woman ever joined this community. Mrs.
Lamb merely followed wheresoever her husband
led,&mdash;&quot;as ballast for his balloon,&quot; as she
said, in her bright way.</p>

<p>Miss Jane Gage was a stout lady of mature
years, sentimental, amiable, and lazy. She
wrote verses copiously, and had vague yearnings
and graspings after the unknown, which
led her to believe herself fitted for a higher
sphere than any she had yet adorned.</p>

<p>Having been a teacher, she was set to instructing
the children in the common branches.
Each adult member took a turn at the infants;
and, as each taught in his own way, the result
was a chronic state of chaos in the minds of
these much-afflicted innocents.</p>

<p>Sleep, food, and poetic musings were the
desires of dear Jane's life, and she shirked all
duties as clogs upon her spirit's wings. Any
thought of lending a hand with the domestic
drudgery never occurred to her; and when to
the question, &quot;Are there any beasts of burden
on the place?&quot; Mrs. Lamb answered, with a
face that told its own tale, &quot;Only one woman!&quot;
the buxom Jane took no shame to herself, but
laughed at the joke, and let the stout-hearted
sister tug on alone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the poor lady hankered after
the flesh-pots, and endeavored to stay herself
with private sips of milk, crackers, and cheese,
and on one dire occasion she partook of fish at
a neighbor's table.</p>

<p>One of the children reported this sad lapse
from virtue, and poor Jane was publicly reprimanded
by Timon.</p>

<p>&quot;I only took a little bit of the tail,&quot; sobbed
the penitent poetess.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but the whole fish had to be tortured
and slain that you might tempt your carnal appetite
with that one taste of the tail. Know
ye not, consumers of flesh meat, that ye
are nourishing the wolf and tiger in your
bosoms?&quot;</p>

<p>At this awful question and the peal of laughter
which arose from some of the younger brethren,
tickled by the ludicrous contrast between
the stout sinner, the stern judge, and the
naughty satisfaction of the young detective,
poor Jane fled from the room to pack her
trunk, and return to a world where fishes' tails
were not forbidden fruit.</p>

<p>Transcendental wild oats were sown broadcast
that year, and the fame thereof has not
yet ceased in the land; for, futile as this crop
seemed to outsiders, it bore an invisible harvest,
worth much to those who planted in earnest.
As none of the members of this particular
community have ever recounted their experiences
before, a few of them may not be amiss,
since the interest in these attempts has never
died out and Fruitlands was the most ideal
of all these castles in Spain.&mdash;<i>Silver Pitchers,
and Other Stories</i>.</p>

<p><i>To the Chief-Justice of Glenwood</i>,</p>

<p>SUBLIME SIR: ... What can be more
destructive of the higher forms of conversation
than a pun? What right has any one to explode
a petard in the midst of sweet sociality,
and blow every thing like sequence and sentiment
sky-high? And therefore, since you, as
translator of the Pasha's Letters, have taken
pains to publish his observations on many
social subjects, I think it eminently proper that
you should ventilate the ideas of his friend
Tompkins upon a not less important theme.</p>

<p>Happily, I have been saved the trouble of
original composition, by a discovery made by
my landlady while I was boarding a year ago
on St. John's Park. Mr. Green, our attic
boarder, went off suddenly one day to see a
friend in the country, as he said. Of course
our landlady searched his room, with a view of
reading his letters; and in a brown hair-trunk,
with a boot-jack, a razor-strop, a box of Seidlitz
powders, and an odd volume of Young's Night
Thoughts, she found the following manuscript.
The females of the house were satisfied with
reading such letters as were left by Mr. Green
in his apartment, and so this paper was handed
over to me. I may say that it was marked with
pencil, &quot;Declined with Thanks.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;THE PUN FIEND.</p>

<p>&quot;BY C. GREEN.</p>

<p>&quot;I used to be corpulent, rosy-cheeked, and
cheerful. I am gaunt, pale, and morose now.
I used to sleep sweetly; but now I toss about
upon my bed, terrified by hideous visions, and
feelings as of a clammy hand or wet cloth laid on
my face. I was wont to walk about our streets
after business hours, and on Sundays, with a
genuine smile of enjoyment lighting up my
face; but now I hurry along with my eyes cast
down, and I seek by-ways and dark lanes for
my rambles. My friends think I am in love;
persons who know me but slightly, suppose me
a victim to remorse&mdash;imagine that I wear a
hair shirt, and macerate my flesh. They are all
wrong. An old bachelor like myself has long
ago buried the light of love in a tomb, and set
a seal upon the great stone at the door; and as
for remorse, I owe no tailor any thing, and do
not at present blame myself for any great
fault, except having once subscribed for six
months to the New York <i>Morning Cretan</i>.
Nevertheless, my face grows haggard, my step
weary, and even our Thursday's beef <i>&agrave; la mode</i>
fails to tempt my enfeebled appetite.</p>

<p>&quot;I am haunted, haunted by a foul fiend. He
meets me at six, P.M., in our festive dining-room,
and the fork or spoon drops from my
nerveless grasp. He follows me up to the parlor,
where I sometimes talk of an evening to
Miss Pipkin (Miss P. is our fourth story, front),
and I become silent in his presence, and Pipkin
votes me a bore. He sits by my side when I
am playing at whist, and I trump my partner's
trick, and the dear old game becomes disgusting.
He even dared once to follow me into
church, but I cried 'Avaunt!' in a tone so peremptory,
that he fled for a moment. He joined
me, however, as soon as service was over, and
walked from Tenth Street to Madison Square,
with his grizzly arm thurst through mine, and
his diabolical jeers drumming on my tympana.
In dreams he perches on my breast, and
clutches me by the throat.</p>

<p>&quot;Like the arch fiend, he assumes many
shapes. He is now a tall man, and again a
short man; sometimes young and audacious,
sometimes old and leering. He only once took
a feminine guise: that blessed form was irksome
to him. He prefers the freedom of masculinity
and ineffables. He was once a bookkeeper
like myself; then a young attorney;
then a medical student; then a bald-headed
old gentleman, who seemed to blow a flageolet
for a living; and lately, he has taken the shape
of a well-to-do President of 'The Arkansas and
Arizona Sky Rocket Transportation Company,'
but through all these shifting shapes, I recognize
him and shudder.</p>

<p>&quot;He is known as the Funny Fellow.</p>

<p>&quot;Very glorious are wit and humor. I have
heard many eminent lecturers discourse on the
distinctions, definitions, and value of these airy
good gifts. I remember being especially edified
by the skill with which Spout, the eloquent,
dissected the philosophy of mirth in the same
style and with the same effect that the boy in
the story dissected his grandmamma's bellows
to see how the wind was raised. I agree with
Spout that wit and humor are glorious; that
satire, pricking the balloons of conceit, vain
glory, and hypocrisy, is invaluable; that a good
laugh can come only from a warm heart; that
the man in motley is often wiser than the
judge in ermine or the priest in lawn. These
qualities are goodly in literature. We all love
the kindly humorist from Chaucer to Holmes,
inclusive. How genial and gentle they are, as
they sit with us around the fireside, chucking
us under the chins, and slyly poking us in the
ribs; and in the field how nobly they have
charged upon humbugs and shams. They have
been true knights, chivalrous, kind-hearted,
brave, religious; their spears are slender, perhaps,
yet sharp and elastic as the blades of
Toledo; and as they have galloped up and
down in the lists, gaily caparisoned and cheery,
it has done our hearts good to see how they
have hurled into the dust the pompous, sleepy
champions of error and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>&quot;So too, consider how pleasant a thing is
mirth on the stage. Who does not thank William
the Great for Falstaff, and Hackett for his
personation of the fat knight? Who does not
chuckle over the humors of Autolycus, rogue
and peddler? Who has not felt his eye glisten,
as his lips smiled, when Jesse Rural has spoken,
and who will not say to Ollapod, 'Thank you,
good sir, I owe you one'?</p>

<p>&quot;Ah me! how I used to read those jolly
unctuous authors when I was young, in the old
'sitting-room' at home! The great fire-place
glows before me now; its light dances on the
wall; my mother's hand is on my head; my
sister's eyes are beaming on her lover over in
the darker corner; there is a murmur of pleasant
voices; there are quiet mirth and deep joy.
I lose myself in revery when I think of these
pleasures, and almost forget the Funny Fellow.</p>

<p>&quot;He is pestiferous. If I were in the habit of
profanity, I would let loose upon him an octagonal
oath. If I were a man of muscle, it
would be pleasant to get his head in chancery,
and bruise it. It would be a relief to serve him
with subpoenas, or present him long bills and
demand immediate payment. Was my name
providentially ordered to be Green, that he
might pass verbal contumely upon it? Does
he suppose that a man can live thirty-five years
in this state of probation, without becoming
slightly calloused to a pun on his own name?
Yet he continues to pun on mine as if the process
were highly amusing. Then again he interrupts
any little attempts at pleasing conversation
with his infernal absurdities. I was
speaking one day at the dinner-table of a well-known
orator who had been entertaining the
town, and I flatter myself that my remarks were
critically just as well as deeply interesting. The
wretched being interposed&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'Mr. Green, when you say there was too
much American Eagle in the speaker's discourse,
do you mean that it was a talon-ted
production, and to what claws of the speech do
you especially refer?'</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Pipkin, who had been deeply intent
on my observations, commenced to titter;
what could I do but hang my head and swallow
the rest of the meal in silence? If I had been
possessed of a quick tongue, I would have
lashed him with sarcasms, and Pipkin would
have rejoiced with me in his groans. But no&mdash;I
am slow of speech&mdash;and so I was bound to
submit. After that he was more tyrannical
than ever. He would come stealthily into my
room and garotte me in a conversational way.
He would seem to take me by the throat, saying,
'why don't you laugh&mdash;why don't you
burst with merriment?' and then I would force
a dismal grin, just to get rid of him.</p>

<p>&quot;I said to myself, I will leave this selfish
Sahara called the city and county of New York
I will leave its dust, dirt, carts, confusion, bulls,
bears, Peter Funks, Jeremy Diddlers, and, best
of all, the Funny Fellow. I will take board in
some rural, as well as accessible place; the
mosquitoes and ague of Flushing shall refresh
my frame; the cottages of Astoria, with their
pleasant view of the Penitentiary, shall revive
my wounded spirit; I will exile myself from
my native land to the shores of Jersey; I will
sit beneath the shadow of the Quarantine on
Staten Island. No&mdash;I won't&mdash;I will go to Yonkers&mdash;Yonkers
that looks as though it had been
built on a gentle slope, and then had suffered a
violent attack of earthquake; daily boats shall
convey me from my ledger to my bed and
board, at convenient hours, so that while I post
books in New York by day, I may revel in
breezes, moonbeams, sweet milk, and gentle influences,
by night. There, said I, in a burst of
excusable enthusiasm, I will recline beneath
wide-spreading beeches, and pipe upon an
oaten reed. There will I listen to the soft
bleating of lambs, and scent the fresh breath of
cows; Nature shall touch and thrill me with
her gentle hand; I will see the dear flowers
turn their faces up to receive the kiss of the
rising sun, or the benediction of the summer
shower. There, too, I will meet the members
of the mystic P.B., so that I shall talk of books
other than day-books and blotters: we will discourse
reverently of authors and their creations.
I will not meet the Funny Fellow, for such a
wretch can be produced only in the corrupt
social hot-bed of Gotham.</p>

<p>&quot;So to Yonkers I went. I chose a room
looking out upon the Hudson and the noble
Palisades. I took with me a flute, a copy of
the Bucolics of Virgil, and numerous linen garments.
A great calm came over me. I was
no longer haunted, goaded, oppressed. With
peace nestling in my bosom, I went down to
my first supper in the new boarding-house. A
goodly meal smoked on the table, and the
savor of baked shad, sweetest of smells, went
up. While I sat choking myself with the
bones of this delicious fish, I heard a voice on
the opposite side of the table that sent the
blood to my heart. If I had been feminine,
there would have been a scene.</p>

<p>&quot;He was there: his eyes gloated over the
board, a malicious quirk sat astride his fat lips.
The Funny Fellow spoke to Miss Grasscloth:</p>

<p>&quot;'Why are the fishermen who catch these
shad like wigmakers?'</p>

<p>&quot;'I don't know,'</p>

<p>&quot;'Because they make their living from bare
poles.'</p>

<p>&quot;I ate no more supper. A nausea supervened.
I left the table, rushed into the cool
evening air, and let the fresh breeze visit my
faded cheek. I strolled up the main street of
Yonkers, and as I crushed my toes against the
stones which then adorned that highway, I resolved
to call on my sweet friend Julia &mdash;&mdash;.
Her gentle smile, said I, will console me. She
is not a Funny Fellow. We will talk together
calmly, earnestly, in the moonlight, close by the
great river. I will sit as near to her as her fashionable
garments will permit, and forget my foe.</p>

<p>&quot;We walked together&mdash;Julia and I. We
talked of things good and true. We spoke of
the beauty of the nocturnal scene. Alas! a
fearful, a demoniac change came over the girl's
face. She said:</p>

<p>&quot;'Yes, my friend, we ought to enjoy this
scene&mdash;for we are fine-night beings.'</p>

<p>&quot;I bid a hasty farewell to the large eyes and
gentle smile. She was not much offended at
my abrupt and angry departure, for my salary
is small, my hair is turning grey, and I do not
dance. But I was not entirely discouraged.
I resolved to give Yonkers a fair trial, and a
true verdict to render according to the evidence.
So I frequented the tea-parties and sociables so
common in that wretched town, and strove to
shake off the melancholy that clung to me like
the Old Man of the Sea. To my horror, the
Funny Fellow became multiplied like the reflections
in a shivered mirror. Men and women,
and even young innocent children, became
Funny, and danced about me in a horrible
maze, and squeaked and gibbered, and tossed
their jokes in my face. In one week I made
five mortal enemies by refusing to smile when
their tormenting squibs were exploded in my
eyes. I felt like a rustic pony, who comes in
his simple way into town on the Fourth of
July, and has Chinese crackers and fiery serpents
cast under his heels. One evening, in
particular, they asked me to play the game of
Comparisons (a proverbially odious game, that
could exist only in an effete and degenerate
civilization), in which the entire company tried
to see how Funny they could be; and because
I made stupid answers, I was laughed at by the
young ladies.</p>

<p>&quot;I became disgusted with Yonkers, and returned
to my intramural boarding-house in St.
John's Park. The sidewalk near the house was
in a dilapidated state, through the carelessness
of the contractor, who had stipulated to pave
it properly, but had not paved it at all, except
with good intentions. And therefore, as I came
along, I first besmeared my boots with muck
then tripped my toes against a pile of brick:
and finally fell headlong into the gutter. As I
rose up and denounced, in somewhat loud language,
the idleness and inefficiency of the contractor
who had the work in charge, the Funny
Fellow stood before me, his eyes glaring with
triumph. He spoke in reply to my denunciations:</p>

<p>&quot;' My dear Green, do not call the contractor
lazy and inefficient. I am sure that his is an
energy that never FLAGS!'</p>

<p>&quot;I rushed to the room where I am now sealed.
There is but one hope left me.</p>

<p>&quot;In the Territory of Nebraska, far to the
west thereof, lies a tract of land which the
early French trappers, with shrewd fitness
called the' Mauvaises Terres.' It is a region
of rocks, petrifactions, and other pre-Adamite
peculiarities. In a paper written by Dr. Leid
of Philadelphia, and published by the Smithsonian
Institute, we are assured that there once
lived in these bad lands, turtles six feet square,
and alligators, compared with which the present
squatter sovereigns of the territory are lovely
and refined. The fossil remains of these ancient
inhabitants still encumber the earth of
that region, and make it unpleasant to view
with an agricultural eye; but here and there
the general desolation is relieved by a fertile
valley, with a running brook and green slopes.
White men, whisky, and Funny Fellows have
not yet penetrated there. I will go to this
sanctuary. A snug cabin will contain my necessary
household&mdash;to wit&mdash;twelve shirts and a
Bible. I will plant my corn, and tobacco, and
vines on the fertile slope that looks to the
south; my cattle and sheep shall browse the
rest of the valley, while a few agile goats shall
stand in picturesque positions upon the rocky
monsters described by Dr. Leidy. My guests
shall be the brave and wise red men who never
try to make bad jokes. I do not think they
ever try to be Funny; but to make assurance
doubly sure, I shall not learn their language, so
that any melancholy attempts they may possibly
make, will fall upon unappreciative ears.
By day I will cultivate my crops and tend my
flocks and herds; and in the long evenings
smoke the calumet with the worthy aborigines.
If I should find there some dusky maiden, like
Palmer's Indian girl, who has no idea of puns,
polkas, crinoline, or eligible matches, I will woo
her in savage hyperbole, and she shall light my
pipe with her slender fingers, and beat for me
the tom-tom when I am sad. I will live in a
calm and conscientious way; the Funny Fellow
shall become like the dim recollection of some
horrible dream, and&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Green seems not to have finished his interesting
reflections, and I shall not attempt to
complete them. As well might I try to finish
the Cathedral at Cologne. But I heartily sympathize
with the feelings he has expressed, and
trust that his new home in the West will never
be invaded by conversational garroters.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TOWER_OF_LONDON" id="THE_TOWER_OF_LONDON"></a>THE TOWER OF LONDON.</h2>


<p>MR. PUNCH,&mdash;<i>My Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;I skurcely
need inform you that your excellent
Tower is very pop'lar with pe'ple from the agricultooral
districks, and it was chiefly them
class which I found waitin at the gates the
other mornin.</p>

<p>I saw at once that the Tower was established
on a firm basis. In the entire history of firm
basisis I don't find a basis more firmer than
this one.</p>

<p>&quot;You have no Tower in America?&quot; said a
man in the crowd, who had somehow detected
my denomination.</p>

<p>&quot;Alars! no,&quot; I anserd; &quot;we boste of our enterprise
and improovements, and yit we are devoid
of a Tower. America oh my onhappy
country! thou hast not got no Tower! It's a
sweet Boon.&quot;</p>

<p>The gates was opened after a while, and we
all purchist tickets, and went into a waitin-room.</p>

<p>&quot;My frens,&quot; said a pale-faced little man, in
black close, &quot;this is a sad day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Inasmuch as to how?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean it is sad to think that so many peple
have been killed within these gloomy walls. My
frens, let us drop a tear!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;you must excuse me. Others
may drop one if they feel like it; but as for me,
I decline. The early managers of this institootion
were a bad lot, and their crimes were trooly
orful; but I can't sob for those who died
four or five hundred years ago. If they was
my own relations I couldn't. It's absurd to
shed sobs over things which occurd during the
rain of Henry the Three. Let us be cheerful,&quot;
I continnered. &quot;Look at the festiv Warders,
in their red flannil jackets. They are cheerful,
and why should it not be thusly with us?&quot;</p>

<p>A Warder now took us in charge, and showed
us the Trater's Gate, the armers, and things.
The Trater's Gate is wide enuff to admit about
twenty traters abrest, I should jedge; but beyond
this, I couldn't see that it was superior
to gates in gen'ral.</p>

<p>Traters, I will here remark, are a onfornit
class of peple. If they wasn't, they wouldn't
be traters. They conspire to bust up a country&mdash;they
fail, and they're traters. They bust
her, and they become statesmen and heroes.</p>

<p>Take the case of Gloster, afterwards Old Dick
the Three, who may be seen at the Tower on
horseback, in a heavy tin overcoat&mdash;take Mr.
Gloster's case. Mr. G. was a conspirator of the
basist dye, and if he'd failed, he would have
been hung on a sour apple tree. But Mr. G.
succeeded, and became great. He was slewed
by Col. Richmond, but he lives in history, and
his equestrian figger may be seen daily for a
sixpence, in conjunction with other em'nent
persons, and no extra charge for the Warder's
able and bootiful lectur.</p>

<p>There's one king in this room who is mounted
onto a foaming steed, his right hand graspin
a barber's pole. I didn't learn his name.</p>

<p>The room where the daggers and pistils and
other weppins is kept is interestin. Among this
collection of choice cuttlery I notist the bow and
arrer which those hot-heded old chaps used to
conduct battles with. It is quite like the bow
and arrer used at this day by certain tribes
of American Injuns, and they shoot 'em off
with such a excellent precision that I almost
sigh'd to be an Injun when I was in the Rocky
Mountain regin. They are a pleasant lot them
Injuns. Mr. Cooper and Dr. Catlin have told
us of the red man's wonerful eloquence, and I
found it so. Our party was stopt on the plains
of Utah by a band of Shoshones, whose chief
said:</p>

<p>&quot;Brothers! the pale-face is welcome. Brothers!
the sun is sinking in the west, and Wa-na-bucky-she
will soon cease speakin. Brothers!
the poor red man belongs to a race which is
fast becomin extink.&quot;</p>

<p>He then whooped in a shrill manner, stole all
our blankets and whisky, and fled to the primeval
forest to conceal his emotions.</p>

<p>I will remark here, while on the subjeck of
Injuns, that they are in the main a very shaky
set, with even less sense than the Fenians, and
when I hear philanthropists bewailin the fack
that every year &quot;carries the noble red man
nearer the settin sun,&quot; I simply have to say I'm
glad of it, tho' it is rough on the settin sun.
They call you by the sweet name of Brother
one minit, and the next they scalp you with
their Thomas-hawks. But I wander. Let us
return to the Tower.</p>

<p>At one end of the room where the weppins is
kept, is a wax figger of Queen Elizabeth, mounted
on a fiery stuffed hoss, whose glass eye flashes
with pride, and whose red morocker nostril dilates
hawtily, as if conscious of the royal burden
he bears. I have associated Elizabeth with the
Spanish Armady. She's mixed up with it at
the Surrey Theatre, where <i>Troo to the Core</i> is
bein acted, and in which a full bally core is introjooced
on board the Spanish Admiral's ship,
giving the audiens the idee that he intends
openin a moosic-hall in Plymouth the moment
he conkers that town. But a very interesting
drammer is <i>Troo to the Core</i>, notwithstandin the
eccentric conduct of the Spanish Admiral; and
very nice it is in Queen Elizabeth to make
Martin Truegold a baronet.</p>

<p>The Warder shows us some instrooments of
tortur, such as thumbscrews, throat-collars, etc.,
statin that these was conkered from the Spanish
Armady, and addin what a crooil peple the
Spaniards was in them days&mdash;which elissited
from a bright-eyed little girl of about twelve
summers the remark that she tho't it <i>was</i> rich
to talk about the crooilty of the Spaniards usin
thumbscrews, when he was in a Tower where
so many poor peple's heads had been cut
off. This made the Warder stammer and turn
red.</p>

<p>I was so pleased with the little girl's brightness
that I could have kissed the dear child,
and I would if she'd been six years older.</p>

<p>I think my companions intended makin a
day of it, for they all had sandwiches, sassiges,
etc. The sad-lookin man, who had wanted us
to drop a tear afore we started to go round,
fling'd such quantities of sassige into his mouth
that I expected to see him choke hisself to
death; he said to me, in the Beauchamp Tower,
where the poor prisoners writ their onhappy
names on the cold walls, &quot;This is a sad sight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is indeed,&quot; I anserd. &quot;You're black in
the face. You shouldn't eat sassige in public
without some rehearsals beforehand. You manage
it orkwardly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;I mean this sad room.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, he was quite right. Tho' so long
ago all these drefful things happened, I was
very glad to git away from this gloomy room,
and go where the rich and sparklin Crown Jewils
is kept. I was so pleased with the Queen's
Crown, that it occurd to me what a agree'ble
surprise it would be to send a sim'lar one home
to my wife; and I asked the Warder what was
the vally of a good, well-constructed Crown
like that. He told me, but on cypherin up
up with a pencil the amount of funs I have in
the Jint Stock Bank, I conclooded I'd send her
a genteel silver watch instid.</p>

<p>And so I left the Tower. It is a solid and
commandin edifis, but I deny that it is cheerful.
I bid it adoo without a pang.</p>

<p>I was droven to my hotel by the most melancholly
driver of a four-wheeler that I ever saw.
He heaved a deep sigh as I gave him two shillings.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you six d.'s more,&quot; I said, &quot;if it
hurts you so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't that,&quot; he said, with a hart-rendin
groan, &quot;it's only a way I have. My mind's
upset to-day. I at one time tho't I'd drive you
into the Thames. I've been readin all the
daily papers to try and understand about Governor
Eyre, and my mind is totterin. It's
really wonderful I didn't drive you into the
Thames.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked the onhappy man what his number
was, so I could redily find him in case I should
want him agin, and bad him good-bye. And
then I tho't what a frollicsome day I'd made
of it. Respectably, etc.,</p>

<h2><a name="SCIENCE_AND_NATURAL_HISTORY" id="SCIENCE_AND_NATURAL_HISTORY"></a>SCIENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY.</h2>

<p>Mr. Punch <i>My Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;I was a little disapinted
at not receivin a invitation to jine in the
meetins of the Social Science Congress....</p>

<p>I prepared an Essy on Animals to read before
the Social Science meetins. It is a subjeck
I may troothfully say I have successfully
wrastled with. I tackled it when only nineteen
years old. At that tender age I writ a Essy
for a lit'ry Institoot entitled, &quot;Is Cats to be
trusted?&quot; Of the merits of that Essy it
doesn't becum me to speak, but I may be excoos'd
for mentionin that the Institoot parsed
a resolution that &quot;whether we look upon the
length of this Essy, or the manner in which it
is written, we feel that we will not express any
opinion of it, and we hope it will be read in
other towns.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course the Essy I writ for the Social Science
Society is a more finisheder production
than the one on Cats, which was wroten when
my mind was crood, and afore I had masterd
a graceful and ellygant stile of composition. I
could not even punctooate my sentences proper
at that time, and I observe with pane, on lookin
over this effort of my youth, that its beauty is
in one or two instances mar'd by ingrammaticisms.
This was inexcusable, and I'm surprised
I did it. A writer who can't write in a
grammerly manner better shut up shop.</p>

<p>You shall hear this Essy on Animals. Some
day when you have four hours to spare, I'll
read it to you. I think you'll enjoy it. Or,
what will be much better, if I may suggest&mdash;omit
all picturs in next week's <i>Punch</i>, and do
not let your contributors write eny thing whatever
(et them have a holiday; they can go to
the British Mooseum;) and publish my Essy
intire. It will fill all your collumes full, and
create comment. Does this proposition strike
you? Is it a go?</p>

<p>In case I had read the Essy to the Social
Sciencers, I had intended it should be the
closin attraction. I intended it should finish
the proceedins. I think it would have finished
them. I understand animals better than any
other class of human creatures. I have a very
animal mind, and I've been identified with 'em
doorin my entire perfessional career as a showman,
more especial bears, wolves, leopards and
serpunts.</p>

<p>The leopard is as lively a animal as I ever
came into contack with. It is troo he cannot
change his spots, but you can change 'em for
him with a paint-brush, as I once did in the
case of a leopard who wasn't nat'rally spotted
in a attractive manner. In exhibitin him I
used to stir him up in his cage with a protracted
pole, and for the purpuss of makin him yell and
kick up in a leopardy manner, I used to casionally
whack him over the head. This would
make the children inside the booth scream with
fright, which would make fathers of families
outside the booth very anxious to come in&mdash;because
there is a large class of parents who
have a uncontrollable passion for takin their
children to places where they will stand a
chance of being frightened to death.</p>

<p>One day I whacked this leopard more than
ushil, which elissited a remonstrance from a tall
gentleman in spectacles, who said, &quot;My good
man, do not beat the poor caged animal.
Rather fondle him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll fondle him with a club,&quot; I ansered,
hitting him another whack.</p>

<p>&quot;I prithy desist,&quot; said the gentleman; &quot;stand
aside, and see the effeck of kindness. I understand
the idiosyncracies of these creeturs better
than you do.&quot;</p>

<p>With that he went up to the cage, and
thrustin his face in between the iron bars, he
said, soothingly, &quot;Come hither, pretty creetur.&quot;</p>

<p>The pretty creetur come-hithered rayther
speedy, and seized the gentleman by the whiskers,
which he tore off about enuff to stuff a
small cushion with.</p>

<p>He said &quot;You vagabone, I'll have you indicted
for exhibitin dangerous and immoral
animals.&quot;</p>

<p>I replied, &quot;Gentle Sir, there isn't a animal
here that hasn't a beautiful moral, but you
mustn't fondle 'em. You mustn't meddle
with their idiotsyncracies.&quot;</p>

<p>The gentleman was a dramatic cricket, and
he wrote a article for a paper, in which he said
my entertainment wos a decided failure.</p>

<p>As regards Bears, you can teach 'em to do
interestin things, but they're onreliable. I
had a very large grizzly bear once, who would
dance, and larf, and lay down, and bow his head
in grief, and give a mournful wale, etsetry.
But he often annoyed me. It will be remembered
that on the occasion of the first battle of
Bull Run, it suddenly occurd to the Fed'ral
soldiers that they had business in Washington
which ought not to be neglected, and they all
started for that beautiful and romantic city,
maintainin a rate of speed durin the entire distance
that would have done credit to the celebrated
French steed <i>Gladiateur</i>. Very nat'rally
our Gov'ment was deeply grieved at this defeat;
and I said to my Bear shortly after, as I
was givin a exhibition in Ohio&mdash;I said, &quot;Brewin,
are you not sorry the National arms has sustained
a defeat?&quot; His business was to wale
dismal, and bow his head down, the band (a
barrel origin and a wiolin) playing slow and
melancholy moosic. What did the grizzly old
cuss do, however, but commence darncin and
larfin in the most joyous manner? I had a
narrer escape from being imprisoned for
disloyalty.&mdash;<i>Works</i>.</p>

<p>Some years ago I engaged a celebrated Living
American Skeleton for a tour through Australia.
He was the thinnest man I ever saw.
He was a splendid skeleton. He didn't weigh
any thing scarcely,&mdash;and I said to myself,&mdash;the
people of Australia will flock to see this tremendous
curiosity. It is a long voyage&mdash;as
you know&mdash;from New York to Melbourne&mdash;and
to my utter surprise the skeleton had no
sooner got out to sea than he commenced eating
in the most horrible manner. He had
never been on the ocean before&mdash;and he said it
agreed with him.&mdash;I thought so!&mdash;I never saw
a man eat so much in my life. Beef&mdash;mutton&mdash;pork&mdash;he
swallowed them all like a shark&mdash;and
between meals he was often discovered behind
barrels eating hard-boiled eggs. The result
was that when we reached Melbourne this infamous
skeleton weighed sixty-four pounds
more than I did!</p>

<p>I thought I was ruined&mdash;but I wasn't. I
took him on to California&mdash;another very long sea
voyage&mdash;and when I got him to San Francisco
I exhibited him as a fat man.</p>

<p>It was about noon of a very fair July day,
when Euphemia and myself arrived at the
little town where we were to take the stage up
into the mountains. We were off for a two
weeks' vacation and our minds were a good
deal easier than when we went away before,
and left Pomona at the helm. We had enlarged
the boundaries of Rudder Grange, having
purchased the house, with enough adjoining
land to make quite a respectable farm. Of
course I could not attend to the manifold duties
on such a place, and my wife seldom had a
happier thought than when she proposed that
we should invite Pomona and her husband to
come and live with us. Pomona was delighted,
and Jonas was quite willing to run our farm.
So arrangements were made, and the young
couple were established in apartments in our
back building, and went to work as if taking
care of us and our possessions was the ultimate
object of their lives. Jonas was such a steady
fellow that we feared no trouble from tree-man
or lightning rodder during this absence.</p>

<p>Our destination was a country tavern on the
stage-road, not far from the point where the
road crosses the ridge of the mountain range,
and about sixteen miles from the town. We
had heard of this tavern from a friend of ours,
who had spent a summer there. The surrounding
country was lovely, and the house was kept
by a farmer, who was a good soul, and tried to
make his guests happy. These were generally
passing farmers and wagoners, or stage-passengers,
stopping for a meal, but occasionally a
person from the cities, like our friend, came to
spend a few weeks in the mountains.</p>

<p>So hither we came, for an out-of-the-world
spot like this was just what we wanted. When
I took our place at the stage-office, I inquired
for David Button, the farm tavern-keeper before
mentioned, but the agent did not know
of him.</p>

<p>&quot;However,&quot; said he, &quot;the driver knows everybody
on the road, and he'll set you down at the
house.&quot;</p>

<p>So, off we started, having paid for our tickets
on the basis that we were to ride about sixteen
miles. We had seats on top, and the trip, although
slow,&mdash;for the road wound uphill steadily,&mdash;was
a delightful one. Our way lay, for
the greater part of the time, through the
woods, but now and then we came to a farm, and
a turn in the road often gave us lovely views
of the foot-hills and the valleys behind us.</p>

<p>But the driver did not know where Dutton's
tavern was. This we found out after we had
started. Some persons might have thought it
wiser to settle this matter before starting, but I
am not at all sure that it would have been so.
We were going to this tavern, and did not wish
to go anywhere else. If people did not know
where it was, it would be well for us to go and
look for it. We knew the road that it was on,
and the locality in which it was to be found.</p>

<p>Still, it was somewhat strange that a stage-driver,
passing along the road every week-day,&mdash;one
day one way, and the next the other
way,&mdash;should not know a public-house like
Dutton's.</p>

<p>&quot;If I remember rightly,&quot; I said, &quot;the stage
used to stop there for the passengers to take
supper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, it ain't on this side o' the ridge,&quot;
said the driver; &quot;we stop for supper, about a
quarter of a mile on the other side, at Pete
Lowry's. Perhaps Dutton used to keep that
place. Was it called the 'Ridge House'?&quot;</p>

<p>I did not remember the name of the house,
but I knew very well that it was not on the
other side of the ridge.</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; said the driver, &quot;I'm sure I don't
know where it is. But I've only been on the
road about a year, and your man may 'a' moved
away afore I come. But there ain't no tavern
this side the ridge, arter ye leave Delhi, and,
that's nowhere's nigh the ridge.&quot;</p>

<p>There were a couple of farmers who were sitting
by the driver, and who had listened with
considerable interest to this conversation. Presently,
one of them turned around to me and
said:</p>

<p>&quot;Is it Dave Dutton ye're askin' about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied, &quot;that's his name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think he's dead,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>At this, I began to feel uneasy, and I could
see that my wife shared my trouble.</p>

<p>Then the other farmer spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe he's dead, Hiram,&quot; said he
to his companion. &quot;I heerd of him this spring.
He's got a sheep-farm on the other side o' the
mountain, and he's a livin' there. That's what
I heerd, at any rate. But he don't live on this
road any more,&quot; he continued, turning to us.
&quot;He used to keep tavern on this road, and the
stages did used to stop fur supper&mdash;or else dinner.
I don't jist ree-collect which. But he
don't keep tavern on this road no more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; said his companion, &quot;if
he's a livin' over the mountain. But I b'lieve
he's dead.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked the other farmer if he knew how long
it had been since Dutton had left this part of
the country.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know fur certain,&quot; he said, &quot;but I
know he was keeping tavern here two year'
ago, this fall, fur I came along here, myself, and
stopped there to git supper&mdash;or dinner, I don't
jist ree-collect which.&quot;</p>

<p>It had been three years since our friend had
boarded at Dutton's house. There was no
doubt that the man was not living at his old
place now. My wife and I now agreed that it
was very foolish in us to come so far without
making more particular inquiries. But we had
had an idea that a man who had a place like
Dutton's tavern would live there always.</p>

<p>&quot;What are ye goin' to do?&quot; asked the
driver, very much interested, for it was not
every day that he had passengers who had lost
their destination. &quot;Ye might go on to Lowry's.
He takes boarders sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>But Lowry's did not attract us. An ordinary
country-tavern, where stage-passengers took
supper, was not what we came so far to find.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know where this house o' Dutton's
is?&quot; said the driver, to the man who had once
taken either dinner or supper there.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes! I'd know the house well enough,
if I saw it. It's the fust house this side o'
Lowry's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With a big pole in front of it?&quot; asked the
driver.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, there was a sign-pole in front of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' a long porch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! well!&quot; said the driver, settling himself
in his seat. &quot;I know all about that house.
That's a empty house. I didn't think you
meant that house. There's nobody lives there.
An' yit, now I come to remember, I have seen
people about, too. I tell ye what ye better do.
Since ye're so set on staying on this side the
ridge, ye better let me put ye down at Dan
Carson's place. That's jist about quarter of a
mile from where Dutton used to live. Dan's
wife can tell ye all about the Duttons, an'
about everybody else, too, in this part o' the
country, and if there aint nobody livin' at the
old tavern, ye can stay all night at Carson's,
and I'll stop an' take you back, to-morrow,
when I come along.&quot;</p>

<p>We agreed to this plan, for there was nothing
better to be done, and, late in the afternoon,
we were set down with our small trunk&mdash;for we
were traveling under light weight&mdash;at Dan
Carson's door. The stage was rather behind
time, and the driver whipped up and left us to
settle our own affairs. He called back, however,
that he would keep a good look-out for us
to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carson soon made her appearance, and,
very naturally, was somewhat surprised to see
visitors with their baggage standing on her
little porch. She was a plain, coarsely dressed
woman, with an apron full of chips and kindling
wood, and a fine mind for detail, as we
soon discovered.</p>

<p>&quot;Jist so,&quot; she said, putting down the chips
and inviting us to seats on a bench. &quot;Dave
Dutton's folks is all moved away. Dave has a
good farm on the other side o' the mountain,
an' it never did pay him to keep that tavern,
'specially as he didn't sell liquor. When he
went away, his son Al come there to live with
his wife, an' the old man left a good deal o'
furniture and things for him, but Al's wife aint
satisfied here, and, though they've been here,
off an' on, the house is shet up most o' the
time. It's for sale an' to rent, both, ef enybody
wants it. I'm sorry about you, too, fur
it was a nice tavern, when Dave kept it.&quot;</p>

<p>We admitted that we were also very sorry,
and the kind-hearted woman showed a great
deal of sympathy.</p>

<p>&quot;You might stay here, but we haint got no
fit room where you two could sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>At this, Euphemia and I looked very blank.</p>

<p>&quot;But you could go up to the house and stay,
jist as well as not,&quot; Mrs. Carson continued.
&quot;There's plenty o' things there, an' I keep the
key. For the matter o' that, ye might take the
house for as long as ye want to stay; Dave 'd
be glad enough to rent it; and, if the lady
knows how to keep house, it wouldn't be no
trouble at all, jist for you two. We could let
ye have all the victuals ye'd want, cheap, and
there's plenty o' wood there, cut, and every
thing handy.&quot;</p>

<p>We looked at each other. We agreed. Here
was a chance for a rare good time. It might
be better, perhaps, than any thing we had expected.</p>

<p>The bargain was struck. Mrs. Carson, who
seemed vested with all the necessary powers of
attorney, appeared to be perfectly satisfied with
our trustworthiness, and when I paid on the
spot the small sum she thought proper for two
weeks' rent, she evidently considered she had
done a very good thing for Dave Dutton and
herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll jist put some bread, an' eggs, an' coffee,
an' pork, an' things in the basket, an' I'll have
'em took up for ye, with yer trunk, an' I'll go
with ye an' take some milk. Here, Danny!&quot;
she cried, and directly her husband, a long,
thin, sun-burnt, sandy-headed man, appeared,
and to him she told, in a few words, our story,
and ordered him to hitch up the cart and be
ready to take our trunk and the basket up to
Dutton's old house.</p>

<p>When all was ready, we walked up the hill,
followed by Danny and the cart. We found
the house a large, low, old-fashioned farm-house,
standing near the road with a long
piazza in front, and a magnificent view of
mountain-tops in the rear. Within, the lower
rooms were large and low, with quite a good
deal of furniture in them. There was no earthly
reason why we should not be perfectly jolly
and comfortable here. The more we saw the
more delighted we were at the odd experience
we were about to have. Mrs. Carson busied
herself in getting things in order for our supper
and general accommodation. She made
Danny carry our trunk to a bedroom in the
second story, and then set him to work building
a fire in a great fire-place, with a crane for
the kettle.</p>

<p>When she had done all she could, it was nearly
dark, and after lighting a couple of candles, she
left us, to go home and get supper for her own
family.</p>

<p>As she and Danny were about to depart in
the cart, she ran back to ask us if we would like
to borrow a dog.</p>

<p>&quot;There aint nuthin to be afeard of,&quot; she
said; &quot;for nobody hardly ever takes the trouble
to lock the doors in these parts, but bein' city
folks, I thought ye might feel better if ye had
a dog.&quot;</p>

<p>We made haste to tell her that we were not
city folks, but declined the dog. Indeed, Euphemia
remarked that she would be much more
afraid of a strange dog than of robbers.</p>

<p>After supper, which we enjoyed as much as
any meal we ever ate in our lives, we each took
a candle, and after arranging our bedroom for
the night, we explored the old house. There
were lots of curious things everywhere,&mdash;things
that were apparently so &quot;old timey,&quot; as my
wife remarked, that David Dutton did not care
to take them with him to his new farm, and so
left them for his son, who probably cared for
them even less than his father did. There was
a garret extending over the whole house, and
filled with old spinning-wheels, and strings of
onions, and all sorts of antiquated bric-a-brac,
which was so fascinating to me that I could
scarcely tear myself away from it; but Euphemia,
who was dreadfully afraid that I would set
the whole place on fire, at length prevailed on
me to come down.</p>

<p>We slept soundly that night, in what was
probably the best bedroom in the house, and
awoke with a feeling that we were about to enter
on a period of some uncommon kind of jollity,
which we found to be true when we went
down to get breakfest. I made the fire, Euphemia
made the coffee, and Mrs. Carson came
with cream and some fresh eggs. The good
woman was in high spirits. She was evidently
pleased at the idea of having neighbors, temporary
though they were, and it had probably been
a long time since she had had such a chance of
selling milk, eggs, and sundries. It was almost
the same as opening a country store. We
bought groceries and every thing of her.</p>

<p>We had a glorious time that day. We were
just starting out for a mountain stroll when
our stage-driver came along on his down trip.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; he called out. &quot;Want to go back
this morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit of it,&quot; I cried. &quot;We wont go
back for a couple of weeks. We've settled
here for the present.&quot;</p>

<p>The man smiled. He didn't seem to understand
it exactly, but he was evidently glad to
see us so well satisfied. If he had had time to
stop and have the matter explained to him, he
would probably have been better satisfied; but
as it was, he waved his whip to us and drove
on. He was a good fellow.</p>

<p>We strolled all day, having locked up the
house and taken our lunch with us; and when
we came back, it seemed really like coming
home. Mrs. Carson, with whom we had left
the key, had brought the milk and was making
the fire. This woman was too kind. We determined
to try and repay her in some way. After
a splendid supper we went to bed happy.</p>

<p>The next day was a repetition of this one,
but the day after it rained. So we determined
to enjoy the old tavern, and we rummaged
about everywhere. I visited the garret again,
and we went to the old barn, with its mows
half full of hay, and had rare times climbing
about there. We were delighted that it happened
to rain. In a wood-shed, near the house,
I saw a big square board with letters on it. I
examined the board, and found it was a sign,&mdash;a
hanging sign,&mdash;and on it was painted in
letters that were yet quite plain:</p>

<p>
&quot;FARMERS'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">AND</span><br />
MECHANICS'<br />
HOTEL.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>I called to Euphemia and told her that I had
found the old tavern sign. She came to look
at it, and I pulled it out.</p>

<p>&quot;Soldiers and sailors!&quot; she exclaimed; &quot;that's
funny.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked over on her side of the sign, and,
sure enough, there was the inscription:</p>

<p>
&quot;SOLDIERS'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">AND</span><br />
SAILORS'<br />
HOUSE.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;They must have bought this comprehensive
sign in some town,&quot; I said. &quot;Such a name
would never have been chosen for a country
tavern like this. But I wish they hadn't taken
it down. The house would look more like
what it ought to be with its sign hanging
before it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Euphemia, &quot;let's put it
up.&quot;</p>

<p>I agreed instantly to this proposition, and we
went to look for a ladder. We found one in
the wagon-house, and carried it out to the sign-post
in the front of the house. It was raining,
gently, during these performances, but we had
on our old clothes, and were so much interested
in our work that we did not care for a little
rain. I carried the sign to the post, and then,
at the imminent risk of breaking my neck, I
hung it on its appropriate hooks on the transverse
beam of the sign-post. Now our tavern
was really what it pretended to be. We gazed
on the sign with admiration and content.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think we had better keep it up all
the time?&quot; I asked of my wife.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said she. &quot;It's a part of the
house. The place isn't complete without it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But suppose some one should come along
and want to be entertained?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But no one will. And if people do come,
I'll take care of the soldiers and sailors, if you
will attend to the farmers and mechanics.&quot;</p>

<p>I consented to this, and we went in-doors to
prepare dinner.&mdash;<i>Rudder Grange</i>.</p>


<h2><a name="A_PIECE_OF_RED_CALICO" id="A_PIECE_OF_RED_CALICO"></a>A PIECE OF RED CALICO.</h2>

<p>Mr. Editor:&mdash;If the following true experience
shall prove of any advantage to any of your
readers, I shall be glad.</p>

<p>I was going into town the other morning,
when my wife handed me a little piece of red
calico, and asked me if I would have time during
the day, to buy her two yards and a half of
calico like that. I assured her that it would be
no trouble at all; and putting the piece of calico
in my pocket, I took the train for the city.</p>

<p>At lunch-time I stopped in at a large dry-goods
store to attend to my wife's commission.
I saw a well-dressed man walking the floor between
the counters, where long lines of girls
were waiting on much longer lines of customers,
and asked him where I could see some red
calico.</p>

<p>&quot;This way, sir,&quot; and he led me up the store.
&quot;Miss Stone,&quot; said he to a young lady, &quot;show
this gentleman some red calico.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What shade do you want?&quot; asked Miss
Stone.</p>

<p>I showed her the little piece of calico that
my wife had given me. She looked at it and
handed it back to me. Then she took down a
great roll of red calico and spread it out on the
counter.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, that isn't the shade!&quot; said I.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not exactly,&quot; said she; &quot;but it is prettier
than your sample.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That may be,&quot; said I; &quot;but, you see, I
want to match this piece. There is something
already made of this kind of calico, which
needs to be made larger, or mended, or something.
I want some calico of the same shade.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl made no answer, but took down another
roll.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the shade,&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied, &quot;but it's striped.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stripes are more worn than any thing else
in calicoes,&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; but this isn't to be worn. It's for
furniture, I think. At any rate, I want perfectly
plain stuff, to match something already in use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't think you can find it perfectly
plain, unless you get Turkey-red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is Turkey-red?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Turkey-red is perfectly plain in calicoes,&quot;
she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let me see some.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We haven't any Turkey-red calico left,&quot;
she said, &quot;but we have some very nice plain
calicoes in other colors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want any other color. I want stuff
to match this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's hard to match cheap calico like that,&quot;
she said, and so I left her.</p>

<p>I next went into a store a few doors farther
up Broadway. When I entered I approached
the &quot;floor-walker,&quot; and handing him my sample,
said:</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any calico like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said he. &quot;Third counter to the
right.&quot;</p>

<p>I went to the third counter to the right, and
showed my sample to the saleman in attendance
there. He looked at it on both sides.
Then he said:</p>

<p>&quot;We haven't any of this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That gentleman said you had,&quot; said I.</p>

<p>&quot;We had it, but we're out of it now. You'll
get that goods at an upholsterer's.&quot;</p>

<p>I went across the street to an upholsterer's.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any stuff like this?' I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the salesman. &quot;We haven't. Is
it for furniture?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Then Turkey-red is what you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is Turkey-red just like this?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said he; &quot;but it's much better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That makes no difference to me,&quot; I replied.
&quot;I want something just like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they don't use that for furniture,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>&quot;I should think people could use any thing
they wanted for furniture,&quot; I remarked, somewhat
sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;They can, but they don't,&quot; he said quite
calmly. &quot;They don't use red like that. They
use Turkey-red.&quot;</p>

<p>I said no more, but left. The next place I
visited was a very large dry-goods store. Of
the first salesman I saw I inquired if they kept
red calico like my sample.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll find that on the second story,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>I went up-stairs. There I asked a man:</p>

<p>&quot;Where will I find red calico?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the far room to the left. Right over
there.&quot; And he pointed to a distant corner.</p>

<p>I walked through the crowds of purchasers
and salespeople, and around the counters and
tables filled with goods, to the far room to the
left. When I got there I asked for red calico.</p>

<p>&quot;The second counter down this side,&quot; said
the man.</p>

<p>I went there and produced my sample. &quot;Calicoes
down-stairs,&quot; said the man.</p>

<p>&quot;They told me they were up here,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Not these plain goods. You'll find 'em
down-stairs at the back of the store, over on
that side.&quot;</p>

<p>I went down-stairs to the back of the store.</p>

<p>&quot;Where will I find red calico like this?&quot; I
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Next counter but one,&quot; said the man addressed,
walking with me in the direction
pointed out.</p>

<p>&quot;Dunn, show red calicoes.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Dunn took my sample and looked at it.</p>

<p>&quot;We haven't this shade in that quality of
goods,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, have you it in any quality of goods?&quot;
I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; we've got it finer.&quot; And he took
down a piece of calico, and unrolled a yard or
two of it on the counter.</p>

<p>&quot;That's not this shade,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said he. &quot;The goods is finer and the
color's better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want it to match this,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you weren't particular about the
match,&quot; said the salesman. &quot;You said you
didn't care for the quality of the goods, and
you know you can't match goods without you
take into consideration quality and color both.
If you want that quality of goods in red, you
ought to get Turkey-red.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not think it necessary to answer this
remark, but said:</p>

<p>&quot;Then you've got nothing to match this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir. But perhaps they may have it in
the upholstery department, in the sixth
story.&quot;</p>

<p>So I got in the elevator and went up to the
top of the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any red stuff like this?&quot; I said
to a young man.</p>

<p>&quot;Red stuff? Upholstery department,&mdash;other
end of this floor.&quot;</p>

<p>I went to the other end of the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;I want some red calico,&quot; I said to a man.</p>

<p>&quot;Furniture goods?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said I.</p>

<p>&quot;Fourth counter to the left.&quot;</p>

<p>I went to the fourth counter to the left, and
showed my sample to a salesman. He looked
at it, and said:</p>

<p>&quot;You'll get this down on the first floor&mdash;calico
department.&quot;</p>

<p>I turned on my heel, descended in the elevator,
and went out on Broadway. I was thoroughly
sick of red calico. But I determined to
make one more trial. My wife had bought her
red calico not long before, and there must be some
to be had somewhere. I ought to have asked
her where she bought it, but I thought a simple
little thing like that could be bought anywhere.</p>

<p>I went into another large dry-goods store.
As I entered the door a sudden tremor seized
me. I could not bear to take out that piece of
red calico. If I had had any other kind of a
rag about me&mdash;a pen-wiper or any thing of the
sort&mdash;I think I would have asked them if they
could match that.</p>

<p>But I stepped up to a young woman and presented
my sample, with the usual question.</p>

<p>&quot;Back room, counter on the left,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>I went there.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any red calico like this?&quot; I asked
of the lady behind the counter.</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she said, &quot;but we have it in Turkey-red.&quot;</p>

<p>Turkey-red again! I surrendered.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; I said, &quot;give me Turkey-red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How much, sir?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know&mdash;say five yards.&quot;</p>

<p>The lady looked at me rather strangely, but
measured off five yards of Turkey-red calico.
Then she rapped on the counter and called out
&quot;cash!&quot; A little girl, with yellow hair in two
long plaits, came slowly up. The lady wrote
the number of yards, the name of the goods,
her own number, the price, the amount of the
bank-note I handed her, and some other matters,
probably the color of my eyes, and the
direction and velocity of the wind, on a slip of
paper. She then copied all this in a little book
which she kept by her. Then she handed the
slip of paper, the money, and the Turkey-red
to the yellow-haired girl. This young girl
copied the slip in a little book she carried, and
then she went away with the calico, the paper
slip, and the money.</p>

<p>After a very long time,&mdash;during which the
little girl probably took the goods, the money,
and the slip to some central desk, where the
note was received, its amount and number
entered in a book, change given to the girl, a
copy of the slip made and entered, girl's entry
examined and approved, goods wrapped up,
girl registered, plaits counted and entered on a
slip of paper and copied by the girl in her
book, girl taken to a hydrant and washed,
number of towel entered on a paper slip and
copied by the girl in her book, value of my
note and amount of change branded somewhere
on the child, and said process noted on a slip of
paper and copied in her book,&mdash;the girl came
to me, bringing my change and the package of
Turkey-red calico.</p>

<p>I had time for but very little work at the
office that afternoon, and when I reached home,
I handed the package of calico to my wife
She unrolled it and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&quot;Why, this don't match the piece I gave
you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Match it!&quot; I cried. &quot;Oh, no! it don't
match it. You didn't want that matched.
You were mistaken. What you wanted was
Turkey-red&mdash;third counter to the left. I mean,
Turkey-red is what they use.&quot;</p>

<p>My wife looked at me in amazement, and
then I detailed to her my troubles.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said she, &quot;this Turkey-red is a great
deal prettier than what I had, and you've got
so much of it that I needn't use the other at
all. I wish I had thought of Turkey-red
before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish from my heart you had,&quot; said I.</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Pen! I am sorry to say it,
but for a person alive and well&mdash;tolerably
well and very much alive, that is&mdash;she did
use to make the greatest business of dying!
Alive! why, when she was stretched out on the
sofa, after an agony of asthma, or indigestion,
or whatever, and had called us all about her
with faltering and tears, and was apparently at
her last gasp, she would suddenly rise, like her
own ghost, at the sound of a second ringing of
the door-bell, which our little renegade Israel
had failed to answer, and declare if she could
only once lay hands on Israel she would box his
ears till they heard!</p>

<p>For the door-bell was, perhaps, among many,
one of Aunt Pen's weakest points. She knew
everybody in town, as you might say. She was
exceedingly entertaining to everybody outside
the family. She was a great favorite with everybody.
Countless gossips came to see her, tinkling
at the door-bell, and hated individually by
Israel, brought her all the news, heard all the
previous ones had brought, admired her, praised
her, pitied her, listened to her, and went away
leaving her in such satisfied mood that she did
not die any more that day. And as they went
away they always paused at the door to say to
some one of us what a cheerful invalid Aunt
Pen had made herself, and what a nest of sunbeams
her room always was, and what a lesson
her patience and endurance ought to be. But,
oh dear me, how very little they knew about it
all!</p>

<p>We all lived together, as it happened; for
when we children were left alone with but a
small income, Aunt Pen&mdash;who was also alone,
and only five years my senior&mdash;wrote word that
we might as well come to her house in the city,
for it wouldn't make expenses more, and might
make them less if we divided them; and then,
too, she said she would always be sure of one
out of three bright and reasonable nurses. Poor
Aunt Pen! perhaps she didn't find us either so
bright or so reasonable as she had expected; for
we used to think that in her less degree she
went on the same principle with the crazy man
who declared all the rest of the world except
himself insane.</p>

<p>In honest truth, as doctor after doctor was
turned away by the impatient and distempered
woman up-stairs, each one took occasion to say
to us down-stairs that our aunt's illness was of
that nature that all the physic it required was
to have her fancies humored, and that we never
need give ourselves any uneasiness, for she
would doubtless live to a good old age, unless
some acute disease should intervene, as there
was nothing at all the matter with her except a
slight nervous sensitiveness, that never destroyed
anybody. I suppose we were a set of
young heathen, for really there were times, if
you will believe it, when that was not the most
reassuring statement in the world.</p>

<p>However. Sometimes Aunt Pen found a
doctor, or a medicine, or a course of diet, or
something, that gave her great sensations of
relief, and then she would come down, and go
about the house, and praise our administration,
and say every thing went twice as far as it used
to go before we came, and tell us delightful
stories, of our mother's housewifely skill, and be
quite herself again; and she would make the
table ring with laughing, and give charming
little tea-parties; and then we all did wish that
Aunt Pen would live forever&mdash;and be down-stairs.
But probably the next day, after one of
the tea-parties, oysters, or claret punch, or hot
cakes, or all together, had wrought their diablerie,
and the doctor was sent for, and the
warming-pan was brought out, and there was
another six weeks' siege, in which, obeyed by
every one, and physicked by herself, and sympathized
with to her heart's content by callers,
and shut up in a hot room with the windows
full of flowering plants, and somebody reading
endless novels to her with the lights burning all
night long&mdash;if she wasn't ill she had every inducement
to be, and nothing but an indomitable
constitution hindered it. It was perfectly
idle for us to tell her she was hurting herself;
it only made her very indignant with us, and
more determined than ever to persist in doing
so.</p>

<p>Of course, then, the longer Aunt Pen staid in
her own room the worse she really did get, and
her nerves, with confinement and worry and
relaxation, would by-and-by be in a condition
for any sort of an outburst if we attempted the
least reasoning with her. She would become,
for one thing, as sleepless as an owl; then she
was thoroughly sure she was going to be insane,
and down would go the hydrate of chloral till
the doctor forbade it on pain of death. After
the chloral, too, such horrid eyes as she had!
the eyes, you know, that chloral always leaves&mdash;inflamed,
purple, swollen, heavy, crying, and
good for any thing but seeing. Immediately
then Aunt Pen went into a new tantrum; she
was going to be stone-blind, and dependent on
three heartless hussies for all her mercies in this
life; but no, thank goodness! she had friends
that would see she did not go absolutely to the
wall, and would never suffer her to be imposed
on by a parcel of girls who didn't care whether
she lived or died&mdash;who perhaps would rather
she did die&mdash;who stood open-handed for her
bequests; she would leave her money to the
almshouse, and if we wanted it we could go
and get it there! And after that, to be sure,
Aunt Pen would have a fit of remorse for her
words, and confess her sin chokingly, and have
us all come separately and forgive her, and
would say she was the wretchedest woman on
the face of the earth, that she should live undesired
until her friends were all tired, and then
die unlamented; and would burst into tears
and cry herself into a tearing headache, and
have ice on her head and a blister on the back
of her neck, and be quite confident that now
she was really going off with congestion of the
brain.</p>

<p>After that, for a day or two, she would be in
a heavenly frame of mind with the blister and
cabbage leaves and simple cerate, and a couple
of mirrors by which to examine the rise and
fall of the blister; and, having had a hint of
real illness, she would consent quite smilingly
to the act of convalescence, and a descent to
the healthy region of the parlors once more.</p>

<p>But no sooner were we all gay and happy in
the house again, running out as we pleased, beginning
to think of parties and drives and
theatres and all enjoyment&mdash;and rather unobservant,
as young folks are apt to be unobservant
of Aunt Pen's slight habitual pensiveness in
the absence of guests or excitement, and of her
ways generally&mdash;than Aunt Pen would challenge
some lobster-salad to mortal combat, and, of
course, come out floored by the colic. A little
whiskey then; and as a little gave so much
ease, she would try a great deal. The result
always was a precipitate retreat up-stairs, a
howling hysteric, bilious cramps, the doctor, a
subcutaneous injection of morphine in her
arm; then chattering like a magpie, relapsed
into awful silence, and, convinced that the morphine
had been carried straight to her heart, a
composing of her hands and feet, an injured
dismissal of every soul from the room, with the
assurance that we should find her straight and
stiff and stone-dead in the morning.</p>

<p>We never did. For, as we seldom had opportunity
of an undisturbed night's rest, we
usually took her at her word if any access of ill
temper, or despair, or drowsiness occasioned
banishment from the presence. Not that we
had always been so calm about it; there was a
time when we were excited with every alarm,
thrown into flurries and panics quite to Aunt
Pen's mind, running after the doctor at two
o'clock of the morning, building a fire in the
range ourselves at midnight to make gruel
for her, rubbing her till we rubbed the skin off
our hands, combing her hair till we went to
sleep standing; but Aunt Pen had cried wolf
so long, and the doctors had all declared so
stoutly that there was no wolf, that our once
soft hearts had become quite hard and concrete.</p>

<p>When at last Aunt Pen had had an alarm
from nearly every illness for which the pharmacop&#339;ia
prescribes, and she knew that neither
we nor the doctors would listen to the probability
of their recurrence; she had an attack of
&quot;sinking.&quot; No, there was no particular disease,
she used to say, only sinking; she had been
pulled down to an extent from which she had
no strength to recuperate; she was only sinking,
a little weaker to-day than she was yesterday&mdash;only
sinking. But Aunt Pen ate a very
good breakfast of broiled birds and toast and
coffee; a very good lunch of cold meats and
dainties, and a great goblet of thick cream; a
very good dinner of soup and roast and vegetables
and dessert, and perhaps a chicken bone at
eleven o'clock in the evening. And when the
saucy little Israel, who carried up her tray,
heard her say she was sinking, he remarked
that it was because of the load on her stomach.</p>

<p>One day, I remember, Aunt Pen was very
much worse than usual. We were all in her
room, a sunshiny place which she had connected
with the adjoining one by sliding-doors,
so that it might be big enough for us all to
bring our work on occasion, and make it lively
for her. She had on a white-cashmere dressing-gown
trimmed with swan's-down, and she lay
among the luxurious cushions of a blue lounge,
with a paler blue blanket, which she had had
one of us tricot for her, lying over her feet, and
altogether she looked very ideal and ethereal;
for Aunt Pen always did have such an eye to
picturesque effect that I don't know how she
could ever consent to the idea of mouldering
away into dust like common clay.</p>

<p>She had sent Maria down for Mel and me to
come up-stairs with whatever occupied us, for
she was convinced that she was failing fast, and
knew we should regret it if we did not have the
last of her. As we had received the same message
nearly every other day during the last
three or four weeks, we did not feel extraordinarily
alarmed, but composedly took our
baskets and scissors, and trudged along after
Maria.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure I ought to be glad that I've succeeded
in training my nieces into such industrious
habits,&quot; said Aunt Pen, after a little
while, looking at Mel; &quot;but I should think
that when a near relative approached the point
of death, the fact might throw needle and thread
into the background for a time.&quot; Then she
paused for Maria to fan a little more breath
into her. &quot;It's different with Helen,&quot; soon
she said; &quot;the white silk shawl she is netting
for me may be needed at any moment to lay
me out in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me, Aunt Pen!&quot; cried Mel; &quot;what a
picture you'd be, laid out in a white net
shawl!&quot; For the doctor had told us to laugh
at these whims all we might.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you heartless girl!&quot; said Aunt Pen.
&quot;To think of pictures at such a time!&quot; And
she closed her eyes as if weary of the world.</p>

<p>&quot;I never saw anybody who liked to revel in
the ghastly the way you do, Aunt Pen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mel!&quot; said Aunt Pen, with quite a show of
color in her cheek; &quot;I shall send you down
stairs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do,&quot; said Mel; &quot;where I can cut out my
gown in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cutting a gown at the bedside of the dying!
Are you cold-blooded, or are you insensible?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Pen,&quot; said Mel, leaning on the point
of her scissors, &quot;you know very well that I have
to make my own dresses or go without them.
And you have kept me running your idle errands,
up and down two flights of stairs, to the
doctor's and the druggist's, and goodness knows
where and all, till I haven't a thread of any
thing that is fit to be seen. You've been
posturing this grand finale of yours, too, all
the last three weeks, and it's time you had it
perfect now; and you must let me alone till I
get my gown done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will do to wear at my funeral,&quot; said Aunt
Pen bitterly, as she concluded.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it won't,&quot; said Mel, doggedly; &quot;it's
red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Red!&quot; cried Aunt Pen, suddenly opening
her eyes, and half raising on one hand. &quot;What
in wonder have you bought a red dress for?
You are quite aware that I can't bear the least
intimation of the color. My nerves are in such
a state that a shred of red makes me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won't see it, you know,&quot; said Mel in
what did seem to me an unfeeling manner.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Aunt Pen. &quot;Very true. I sha'n't
see it. But what,&quot; added she presently snapping
open her eyes, &quot;considered as a mere
piece of economy, you bought a red dress for
when you are immediately going into black,
passes common-sense to conjecture! You had
better send it down and have it dyed at once
before you cut it, for the shrinkage will spoil it
forever if you don't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Much black I shall go into,&quot; said Mel.</p>

<p>Maria laughed. Aunt Pen cried.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Pen,&quot; said the cruel Mel, &quot;if you
were going to die you wouldn't be crying.
Dying people have no tears to shed, the doctors
say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody ought to cry,&quot; said poor Aunt
Pen, witheringly. &quot;Don't talk to me about
doctors,&quot; she continued, after a silence interrupted
only by the snipping of the scissors.
&quot;They are a set of quacks. They know nothing.
I will have all the doctors in town at my
funeral for pall-bearers. It will be a satire too
delicate for them to appreciate, though. Speaking
of that occasion, Helen,&quot; she went on, turning
to me as a possible ally, &quot;I have so many
friends that I suppose the house will be full.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn't you enjoy it more from church,
auntie?&quot; said I.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you hard and wicked girls!&quot; she cried.
&quot;You're all alike. Listen to me! If you won't
hear my wishes, you must take my commands.
Now, in the first place, I want the parlors to be
overflowing with flowers, literally lined with
flowers. I don't care how much money it
takes; there'll be enough left for you&mdash;more
than you deserve. And I want you to be very
sure that I'm not to be exposed unless I look exactly
as I'd like to look. You're to put on my
white silk that I was to have been married in,
and my veil, and the false orange blossoms.
They're all in the third drawer of the press, and
the key's on my chatelaine. And if&mdash;if&mdash;well,&quot;
said Aunt Pen, more to herself than us, &quot;if he
comes, he'll understand. The Bride of Death.&quot;</p>

<p>After that she did not say any more for some
minutes, and we were all silent and sorry, and
Mel was fidgeting in a riot of repentance; we
had never, either of us, heard a word of any
romance of Aunt Pen's before. We began to
imagine that there might be some excuse for
the overthrow of Aunt Pen's nervous system,
some reality in the overthrow. &quot;You will
leave this ring on my finger;&quot; said she; by-and-by.
&quot;If Chauncey Read comes, and wants it,
he will take it off. It will fit his finger as well
now, I suppose, as it did when he wore it before
he gave it to me.&quot; Then Aunt Pen bit
her lip and shut her eyes, and seemed to be
slipping off into a gentle sleep.</p>

<p>&quot;By-the-way!&quot; said she, suddenly, sitting
upright on the lounge, &quot;I won't have the
horses from Brown's livery&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The what, auntie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The horses for the cort&eacute;ge. You know
Brown puts that magnificent span of his in the
hearse on account of their handsome action.
I'm sure Mrs. Gaylard would have been frightened
to death if she could only have seen the
way they pranced at her funeral last fall. I was
determined then that they should never draw
me;&quot; and Aunt Pen shivered for herself beforehand.
&quot;And I can't have them from Timlin's,
for the same reason,&quot; said she. &quot;All his
animals are skittish; and you remember when
a pair of them took fright and dashed away
from the procession and ran straight to the
river, and there'd have been four other funerals
if the schooner at the wharf hadn't stopped
the runaways. And Timlins has a way, too, of
letting white horses follow the hearse with the
first mourning-coach, and it's very bad luck,
very&mdash;an ill omen; a prophecy of Death and the
Pale Horse again, you know. And I won't
have them from Shust's, either,&quot; said Aunt Pen,
&quot;for he is simply the greatest extortioner since
old Isaac the Jew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, auntie,&quot; said Mel, forgetful of her
late repentance, &quot;I don't see but you'll have
to go with Shank's mare.&quot;</p>

<p>Even Aunt Pen laughed then. &quot;Don't you
really think you are going to lose me, girls?&quot;
asked she.</p>

<p>&quot;No, auntie,&quot; replied Maria. &quot;We all think
you are a hypo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A hypo?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a hypocrite,&quot; said Mel, &quot;but a hypochondriac.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I were,&quot; sighed Aunt Pen; &quot;I wish
I were. I should have some hope of myself
then,&quot; said the poor inconsistent innocent.
&quot;Oh no, no; I feel it only too well; I am going
fast. You will all regret your disbelief when I
am gone;&quot; and she lay back among her pillows.
&quot;That reminds me,&quot; she murmured,
presently. &quot;About my monument.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Pen, do be still,&quot; said Mel.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Aunt Pen, firmly; &quot;it may be a
disagreeable duty, but that is all the better
reason for me to bring my mind to it. And if
I don't attend to it now, it never will be attended
to. I know what relatives are. They
put down a slab of slate with a skull and cross-bones
scratched on it, and think they've done
their duty. Not that I mean any reflections on
you; you're all well-meaning, but you're giddy.
I shall haunt you if you do any thing of the
kind! No; you may send Mr. Mason up here
this afternoon, and I will go over his designs
with him. I am going to have carved Carrara
marble, set in a base of polished Scotch granite,
and the inscription is&mdash;Girls!&quot; cried Aunt
Pen, rising and clasping her knees with unexpected
energy, &quot;I expressly forbid my age
being printed in the paper, or on the lid, or on
the stone! I won't gratify every gossip in
town, that I won't! I shall take real pleasure
in baffling their curiosity. And another thing,
while I am about it, don't you ask Tom Maltby
to my funeral, or let him come in, if he comes
himself, on any account whatever. I should
rise in my shroud if he approached me. Yes, I
should! Tom Maltby may be all very well; I
dare say he is; and I hope I die at peace with
him and all mankind, as a good Christian
should. I forgive him; yes, certainly, I forgive
him; but it doesn't follow that I need forget
him; and, so long as I remember him, the way
he conducted in buying the pew over my head
I can't get over, dead or alive. And if I only
do get well we shall have a reckoning that will
make his hair stand on end&mdash;that he may rely
on!&quot; And here Aunt Pen took the fan from
Maria, and moved it actively, till she remembered
herself, when she resigned it. &quot;One
thing more,&quot; she said. &quot;Whatever happens,
Helen, don't let me be kept over Sunday.
There'll certainly be another death in the family
within the year if you do. If I die on Saturday,
there's no help for it. Common decency
won't let you shove me into the ground at
once, and so you will have to make up your
minds for a second summons.&quot; And Aunt
Pen, contemplating the suttee of some one of
us with great philosophy, lay down and closed
her eyes again. &quot;You might have it by torchlight
on Sunday night, though,&quot; said she, half
opening them. &quot;That would be very pretty.&quot;
And then she dropped off to sleep with such a
satisfied expression of countenance that we
judged her to be welcoming in imagination the
guests at her last rites herself.</p>

<p>Whatever the dream was, she was rudely
roused from it by the wreched little Israel, who
came bounding up the stairs, and, without word
or warning, burst into the room, almost white
with horror. Why Israel was afraid I can't
conjecture, but, at any rate, a permanent fright
would have been of great personal advantage
to him. &quot;Oh, ma'am! oh, miss! dere's a pusson
down stairs, a cullud woman, wid der small-pox!&quot;
he almost whistled in his alarm.</p>

<p>&quot;With the small-pox!&quot; cried Aunt Pen,
springing into the middle of the floor, regardless
of her late repose <i>in articulo mortis</i>. &quot;Go
away, Israel! Have you been near her? Put
her out immediately! How on earth did she
get there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You allus telled me to let everybody in,&quot;
chattered Israel.</p>

<p>&quot;Put her out! put her out!&quot; cried Aunt
Pen, half dancing with impatience.</p>

<p>&quot;We can't get her out. She's right acrost
der door-step. We's feared ter tech her.&quot;</p>

<p>But Aunt Pen's head was out of the window,
and she was shouting: &quot;Police! fire! murder!
thieves!&quot; possibly in the order of importance
of the four calamities, but quite as if she had
a plenty of breath left; and, for a wonder, the
police came to the rescue, and directly afterward
an ambulance took the poor victim of the
frightful epidemic to the hospital. I believe it
turned out to be only measles after all, though.</p>

<p>&quot;Run, Israel!&quot; screamed Aunt Pen then;
&quot;run instantly and bring home a couple of
pounds of roll-brimstone, and tell the maids to
riddle the furnace fire and make it as bright and
hot as possible, and to light fires in the parlor
grates, and in the old Latrobe, and in every
room in the house, without losing a minute.
We'll make this house too warm for it!&quot;</p>

<p>And, to our amazement, as soon as Israel
came darting back with the impish material,
Aunt Pen took a piece in each hand, directed
us to do the same, and wrapping the blue afghan
round her shoulders, descended to the
lower rooms three steps at a time, sent for the
doctor to come and vaccinate us, and having
set a chair precisely over the register where a
red-hot stream of air was pouring up, she
placed herself upon it and issued her orders.</p>

<p>Every window was closed, every grate from
basement to attic had a fire lighted in it, and
little pans of brimstone were burning in every
room and hall in the house, while we, astonished,
indignant, frightened, and amused, sat
enduring the torments of vapor and sulphur
baths to the point of suffocation.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't bear this another moment,&quot; wheezed
Mel.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the only way,&quot; replied Aunt Pen, serenely,
with a rivulet trickling down her nose.
&quot;You kill the germs by heat, and since we
can't bake ourselves quite to death, we make
sure of the work by the fumes.&quot;</p>

<p>And as she sat there, her face rubicund, her
swan's-down straight, drops on her cheeks, her
chin, her forehead, and wherever drops could
cling, her eyes watering, her curls limp, and an
atmosphere of unbearable odor enveloping her
in its cloud, the front door opened, and a footstep
rung on the tiles.</p>

<p>&quot;Jess you keep out o' yer!&quot; yelled Israel to
the intruder, seeing it wasn't the doctor.
&quot;We's got der small-pox, and am a-killing de
gemmens&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pen!&quot; cried a man's voice through the
smoke&mdash;a deep, melodious voice.</p>

<p>&quot;What!&quot; exclaimed Aunt Pen, starting up,
and then pausing as if she fancied the horrid
fumes might have befogged her brain.</p>

<p>&quot;Pen!&quot; the voice cried again.</p>

<p>&quot;Chauncey! Chauncey Read!&quot; she shrieked.
&quot;Where do you come from? Am I dreaming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From the North Pacific,&quot; answered the
voice; and we dimly discerned its owner groping
his way forward. &quot;From the five years'
whaling voyage into which I was gagged and
dragged&mdash;shanghaied, they call it. O, Pen, I
didn't dare to hope I should find&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Chauncey, is it you?&quot; she cried, and
fell fainting at his feet.</p>

<p>The draught from the open door after him
was blowing away the smoke, and we saw what
a great, sunburned, handsome fellow it was that
had caught her in his arms, and was bearing
her out to the back balcony and the fresh air
there, used in the course of his whaling voyage,
perhaps, to odors no more belonging to Araby
the Blest than those of burning brimstone do;
and, seeing the movement, we divined that he
knew as much about the resources of the house
as we did, and so we discreetly withdrew, Israel's
head being twisted behind him as he went
to such extent that you might have supposed
he had had his neck wrung.</p>

<p>Well, we put the white silk and the tulle on
Aunt Pen after all; yellow as it was, she would
have no other&mdash;only fresh, natural orange blossoms
in place of the false wreath. And if we
had not so often had her word for it in past
times, we never should have taken her for any
thing but the gayest bride, the most alive and
happy woman in the world. They returned to
the old house from their wedding journey, and
we all live together in great peace and pleasantness.
But though three years are passed and
gone since Chauncey Read came home and
brought a new atmosphere with him into our
lives, Aunt Pen has never had a sick day yet;
and we find that any allusion to her funeral
gives her such a superstitious trembling that we
are pleased to believe it indefinitely postponed,
and by tacit and mutual consent we never say
any thing about it.&mdash;<i>Harper's Magazine</i>, June,
1872.</p>

<p>In compliance with the request of a friend
of mine, who wrote me from the East, I
called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon
Wheeler, and inquired after my friend's friend,
<i>Leonidas W.</i> Smiley, as requested to do, and I
hereunto append the result. I have a lurking
suspicion that <i>Leonidas W.</i> Smiley is a myth;
that my friend never knew such a personage;
and that he only conjectured that, if I asked
old Wheeler about him, it would remind him
of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go
to work and bore me nearly to death with some
infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious
as it should be useless for me. If that was the
design, it certainly succeeded.</p>

<p>I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably
by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated
tavern in the ancient mining camp of Angel's,
and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed,
and had an expression of winning gentleness
and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance.
He roused up and gave me good-day. I told
him a friend of mine had commissioned me to
make some inquiries about a cherished companion
of his boyhood named <i>Leonidas W.</i>
Smiley&mdash;<i>Rev. Leonidas W.</i> Smiley&mdash;a young
minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was
at one time a resident of Angel's Camp. I
added that, if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any
thing about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I
would feel under many obligations to him.</p>

<p>Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and
blockaded me there with his chair, and then sat
me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative
which follows this paragraph. He never
smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his
voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed
the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all
through the interminable narrative there ran a
vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity,
which showed me plainly that, so far from his
imagining that there was any thing ridiculous
or funny about his story, he regarded it as a
really important matter, and admired its two
heroes as men of transcendent genius in <i>finesse</i>.
To me, the spectacle of a man drifting serenely
along through such a queer yarn without ever
smiling, was exquisitely absurd. As I said before,
I asked him to tell me what he knew of
Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
follows. I let him go on in his own way, and
never interrupted him once:</p>

<p>There was a feller here once by the name of
<i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter of '49&mdash;or may be it
was the spring of '50&mdash;I don't recollect exactly,
somehow, though what makes me think it was
one or the other is because I remember the big
flume wasn't finished when he first came to the
camp; but any way he was the curiosest man
about always betting on any thing that turned
up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet
on the other side; and if he couldn't, he'd
change sides. Any way that suited the other
man would suit him&mdash;any way just so's he got
a bet, <i>he</i> was satisfied. But still he was lucky,
uncommon lucky; he most always come out
winner. He was always ready and laying for a
chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing
mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it,
and take any side you please, as I was just
telling you. If there was a horse-race, you'd
find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the
end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on
it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why,
if there was two birds sitting on a fence, he
would bet you which one would fly first; or if
there was a camp-meeting, he would be there
reg'lar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he
judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
so he was, too, and a good man. If he even
seen a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he
would bet you how long it would take him to
get wherever he was going to, and if you took
him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to
Mexico but what he would find out where he
was bound for and how long he was on the
road. Lots of the boys here has seen that
Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it
never made no difference to <i>him</i>&mdash;he would bet
on <i>any</i> thing&mdash;the dangdest feller. Parson
Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good
while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to
save her; but one morning he come in, and
Smiley asked how she was, and he said she was
considerable better&mdash;thank the Lord for his
inf'nit mercy&mdash;and coming on so smart that,
with the blessing of Prov'dence, she'd get well
yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says,
&quot;Well, I'll risk two-and-a-half that she don't,
any way.&quot;</p>

<p>This-yer Smiley had a mare&mdash;the boys called
her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was only
in fun, you know, because, of course, she was
faster than that&mdash;and he used to win money on
that horse, for all she was so slow and always
had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption,
or something of that kind. They
used to give her two or three hundred yards
start, and then pass her under way; but always
at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling
up, and scattering her legs around limber,
sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one
side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing
and sneezing and blowing her nose&mdash;and
always fetch up at the stand just about a neck
ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.</p>

<p>And he had a little small bull pup, that to
look at him you'd think he wan't worth a cent,
but to set around and look ornery, and lay for
a chance to steal something. But as soon as
the money was up on him, he was a different
dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like
the fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would
uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces.
And a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag
him, and bite him, and throw him over his
shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson&mdash;which
was the name of the pup&mdash;Andrew
Jackson would never let on but what <i>he</i> was
satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else&mdash;and
the bets being doubled and doubled on the
other side all the time, till the money was all
up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that
other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and
freeze to it&mdash;not chaw, you understand, but only
jest grip and hang on till they throwed up the
sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come
out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog
once that didn't have no hind legs, because
they'd been sawed off by a circular saw, and
when the thing had gone along far enough, and
the money was all up, and he come to make a
snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how
he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog
had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared
surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like,
and didn't try no more to win the
fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He give
Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was
broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog
that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt
of, which was his main dependence in a fight,
and then he limped off a piece and laid down
and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew
Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself
if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him, and
he had genius&mdash;I know it, because he hadn't
had no opportunities to speak of, and it don't
stand to reason that a dog could make such a
fight as he could under them circumstances, if
he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel
sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n,
and the way it turned out.</p>

<p>Well, this-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and
chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all them kind
of things, till you couldn't rest, and you
couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day,
and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
edercate him; and so he never done nothing
for three months but set in his back yard and
learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he
<i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him a little
punch behind, and the next minute you'd see
that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut&mdash;see
him turn one summerset, or may be a
couple, if he got a good start, and come down
flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got
him up so in the matter of catching flies, and
kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail
a fly every time as far as he could see him.
Smiley said all a frog wanted was education,
and he could do most any thing&mdash;and I believe
him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster
down here on this floor&mdash;Dan'l Webster was
the name of the frog&mdash;and sing out, &quot;Flies,
Dan'l, flies!&quot; and quicker'n you could wink,
he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n
the counter there, and flop down on the floor
again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to
scratching the side of his head with his hind
foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd
been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
You never see a frog so modest and straight-for'ard
as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
when it come to fair and square jumping on a
dead level, he could get over more ground at
one straddle than any animal of his breed you
ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his
strong suit, you understand; and when it come
to that, Smiley would ante up money on him
as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous
proud of his frog, and well he might be, for
fellers that had travelled and been everywheres,
all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see.</p>

<p>Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice
box, and he used to fetch him down town
sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller&mdash;a
stranger in the camp, he was&mdash;come across
him with his box, and says,</p>

<p>&quot;What might it be that you've got in the
box?&quot;</p>

<p>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, &quot;It
might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
be, but it ain't&mdash;it's only just a frog.&quot;</p>

<p>And the feller took it, and looked at it careful,
and turned it round this way and that, and
says, &quot;H'm&mdash;so't is. Well, what's <i>he</i> good
for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Smiley says, easy and careless,
&quot;he's good enough for <i>one</i> thing, I should
judge&mdash;he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras
county.&quot;</p>

<p>The feller took the box again, and took another
long, particular look, and give it back to
Smiley, and says, very deliberate, &quot;Well, I
don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
better'n any other frog.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May be you don't,&quot; Smiley says. &quot;May be
you understand frogs, and may be you don't
understand 'em; may be you've had experience,
and may be you ain't, only a amature, as
it were. Any ways, I've got <i>my</i> opinion, and
I'll risk forty dollars that he can out-jump any
frog in Calaveras county.&quot;</p>

<p>And the feller studied a minute, and then
says, kinder sad like, &quot;Well, I'm only a
stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I
had a frog, I'd bet you.&quot;</p>

<p>And then Smiley says, &quot;That's all right&mdash;that's
all right&mdash;if you'll hold my box a minute,
I'll go and get you a frog.&quot; And so the
feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars
along with Smiley's, and set down to wait.</p>

<p>So he set there a good while thinking and
thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog
out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon
and filled him full of quail shot&mdash;filled
him pretty near up to his chin&mdash;and set him on
the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and
slopped around in the mud for a long time, and
finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in,
and give him to this feller, and says:</p>

<p>&quot;Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of
Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l,
and I'll give the word.&quot; Then he says, &quot;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;jump!&quot;
and him and the feller
touched up the frogs from behind, and the new
frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a heave, and
hysted up his shoulders&mdash;so&mdash;like a Frenchman,
but it wan't no use&mdash;he couldn't budge;
he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he
couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored
out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he
was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea
what the matter was, of course.</p>

<p>The feller took the money and started away;
and when he was going out at the door, he
sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulders&mdash;this
way&mdash;at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate,
&quot;Well, I don't see no pints about that frog
that's any better'n any other frog.&quot;</p>

<p>Smiley he stood scratching his head and
looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last
he says, &quot;I do wonder what in the nation that
frog throw'd off for&mdash;I wonder if there ain't
some thing the matter with him&mdash;he 'pears to
look mighty baggy, somehow.&quot; And he ketched
Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up
and says, &quot;Why, blame my cats, if he don't
weigh five pound!&quot; and turned him upside
down, and he belched out a double handful of
shot. And then he see how it was, and he was
the maddest man&mdash;he set the frog down and
took out after that feller, but he never ketched
him. And&mdash;</p>

<p>(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called
from the front yard, and got up to see what
was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved
away, he said: &quot;Just set where you are,
stranger, and rest easy&mdash;I an't going to be
gone a second.&quot;</p>

<p>But, by your leave, I did not think that a
continuation of the history of the enterprising
vagabond <i>Jim</i> Smiley would be likely to afford
me much information concerning the Rev. <i>Leonidas
W.</i> Smiley, and so I started away.</p>

<p>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler
returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, this-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed
cow that didn't have no tail, only just a
short stump like a bannanner, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, hang Smiley and his afflicted cow!&quot;
I muttered, good-naturedly, and bidding the
old gentleman good-day, I departed.</p>

<h2><a name="BEN_THIRLWALLS_SCHOOLDAYS" id="BEN_THIRLWALLS_SCHOOLDAYS"></a>BEN THIRLWALL'S SCHOOLDAYS.</h2>


<p>My name is Ben Thirlwall, and I am the
son of rich but honest parents. I
never had a wish ungratified until I was twelve
years of age. My wish then was to stay on a
two-year-old colt which had never been broken.
He did not coincide with me, and a vast revelation
of the resistances to individual will of
which the universe is capable, also of a terrestrial
horizon, bottom upward, burst upon me
during the brief space which I spent in flying
over his head. Picked up senseless, I was carried
to the bosom of my family on a wheelbarrow,
and awoke to the consciousness that
my parents had decided on sending me to a
boarding-school,&mdash;a remedy to this day sovereign
in the opinion of all well-regulated parents
for all tangential aberrations from the back of
a colt or the laws of society.</p>

<p>The principal's name was Barker; and my only
clue to his character consisted in overhearing
that he was an excellent disciplinarian. I was
afraid to ask what that meant, but on reflection
concluded it to be a geographical distinction,
and, associating him with Mesopotamia or
Beloochistan, expected to find him a person of
mild manners, who shaved his head, wore a tall
hat of dyed sheep's wool, and did a large business
in spices with people who visited him on
camels in a front-yard surrounded by sheds,
and having a fountain that played in the
middle.</p>

<p>Having read several books of travels, I was
corroborated in my view when I learned that
Mr. Barker lived at the east, and still further,
when on going around point Judith on the
steamboat with my father, I became very sick
at the stomach, as all the travellers had done
in their first chapter.</p>

<p>I need not say that the reality of Mr. Barker
was a very terrible awakening, which contained
no lineament of my purple dream, save the
bastinado. Without distinction of age or
season the youths who, as per circular, enjoyed
the softening influence of his refined Christian
home, rose to the sound of the gong at five
A.M., which may have been very nice in a
home for the early Christians, but was reported
among the boys to have entirely stopped the
growth of Little Briggs. This was a child,
whose mother had married again, and whose
step-father had felt his duty to his future too
keenly to deprive him of the benign influences
of Barker at any time in the last six years.
After rising, we had ten minutes to wash our
faces and hands,&mdash;a period by the experience
of mankind demonstrably insufficient, where
the soap is of that kind very properly denominated
cast-steel (though purists have a different
spelling), and you have to break an inch of ice
to get into the available region of your water-pitcher.
Chunks, who has since made a large
fortune on war-contracts, kept himself in peanuts
and four-cent pies for an entire winter
session, by selling an invention of his own, which
consisted of soap, dissolved in water on the
stove during the day-time, put in bottles hooked
from the lamp-room by means of a false key,
to be carried to bed and kept warm by boys,
whose pocket-money and desire for a prompt
detergent in the morning were adequate to the
disbursement of half a dime a package. I myself
took several violent colds from having the
glass next my skin during severe nights; but
that was nothing so bad as the case of Little
Briggs, who from lack of the half-dime, often
came down to prayers with a stripe of yesterday's
pencil black on one side of his nose, and
a shaving of soap, which, in the frenzy of despair
he had gouged out of his stony cake, on
the other. The state of mind consistent with
such a condition of countenance did not favor
correct recitation of the tougher names in
Deuteronomy; so, it can be a cause of surprise
to no one, that, when called on at prayers, and
prompted by a ridiculous neighbor, little Briggs
sometimes asserted Joshua to have driven out
the Hivites and the Amorites, and the Canaanites
and the Jebusites, and the Hittites and the
Perizzites, and the Moabites and the Musquito-bites,
for which he was regularly sent to bed on
Saturday afternoon, as he had no pocket-money
to stop, his papa desiring him to learn
self-denial young, as he was intended for a missionary;
though goodness knows that there
wasn't enough of him to go round among many
heathen.</p>

<p>From this specimen of discipline may be
learned the entire Barkerian system of training.
I was about to say, &quot;<i>ex uno disce omnes</i>,&quot;
but, as it's the only Latin I remember from
the lot which got rubbed into&mdash;or rather over&mdash;me
at Barker's, I'm rather sparing of it, not
knowing but I can bring it in somewhere else
with better effect. As with the Word of God,
so with that of man,&mdash;the grand Barkerian idea
of how to fix it in a boy's memory was to send
him to bed, or excoriate his palm. If religion
and polite learning could have been communicated
by sheets, like chicken-pox, or blistered
into one like the stern but curative cantharides,
Mr. Barker's boys would have become the envy
of mankind and the beloved of the gods; but
not even Little Briggs died young from the latter
or any other cause, which speaks volumes
for his constitution....</p>

<p>The two Misses Moodle came to establish a
young ladies' seminary in the village of Mungerville,
on whose outskirts our own school
was situated, bringing along with them, as the
county paper stated, &quot;that charming atmosphere
of refinement and intellectuality in
which they ever moved&quot;; and, what was of
more consequence, a capital of twenty girls to
start with. Professional politeness inspired Mr.
Barker to make a call on the fair strangers, which
the personal fascinations of the younger Miss
Moodle induced him to repeat. The atmosphere
of refinement and intellectuality gradually
acted on him in the nature of an intoxicating
gas, until at length, after twenty-five years of
successfully intrenched widowhood, he laid his
heart in the mits of the younger Miss Moodle,
and the two became one Barker.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this union, social relations
began to be established between the two
schools. Mrs. Barker, of an occasional evening,
wished to run down and visit her sister. If Mr.
Barker was engaged in quarrying a page of
Cicero out of some stony boy in whom nature
had never made any Latin deposit, or had just
put a fresh batch of offenders into the penal
oven of untimely bed, and felt compelled to
run up now and then to keep up the fire under
them, by a harrowing description of the way
their parents would feel if they knew of their
behavior&mdash;an instrument dear to Mr. Barker as
a favorite poker to a boss-baker in love with
his profession&mdash;then, after a clucking noise, indicative
of how much he would like to chuck
her under the chin, but for the presence of
company, Mr. Barker would coo to Mrs. Barker,
&quot;Lovey, your pick, sweet!&quot; waving his hand
comprehensively over the whole school-room;
or &quot;Dear, suppose we say Briggs, or Chunks,
or Thirlwall,&quot; as the case might be. The only
difficulty about Briggs was clothes. That used
to be obviated by a selection from the trunks of
intimate friends; and Briggs was such a nice
boy, that it was a real gratification to see him
with your best jacket on. Many's the time the
old fellow has said to Chunks or me, &quot;What a
blessing that I grew! If I hadn't, how could
I ever wear your trousers?&quot; In process of
time these occasional visits, as escort to Mrs.
Barker, expanded into an attendance of all the
older boys (when not in bed for moral baking
purposes) upon a series of bi-monthly soirees,
given by the remaining Miss Moodle, with a
superficial view to her pupils' attainment of
ease in society; and a material substratum of
sandwiches, which Miss Moodle preferred to
see, through the atmosphere of refinement and
intellectuality, as &quot;a simple repast.&quot; To this
was occasionally added a refreshment, which I
have seen elsewhere only at Sunday-school picnics,&mdash;a
mild tap of slightly sweetened water,
which tasted as if lemons had formerly been
kept in the pail it was made in;&mdash;only for
Sunday-schools they make it strong at the outset,
and add water during the hymns, with a
vague but praiseworthy expectation that, in
view of the sacredness of the occasion, there
will be some miraculous interposition, as in the
case of the widow's cruse, to keep the beverage
up to proof; while Miss Moodle's liquor preserved
throughout the evening a weakness of
which generous natures scorned to take advantage
beyond the first tumbler.</p>

<p>At this portion of my career I was dawned
upon by Miss Tucker. From mature years I
look back with a shudder upon the number of
parchmenty sandwiches which I ate, the reservoirs
of lemony water which I drank, in order
to be in that lovely creature's society. I experienced
agonies in thinking how much longer
it might be before I could get a coat with tails,
when I calculated how soon she would be
putting up her back hair. Her eyes were as
blue as I was when I thought she liked Briggs;
and she had a complexion compared with
which strawberries and cream were nowhere.
When she was sent to the piano, to show
people what the Moodle system could do in
the way of a musical education, I fell into a
cataleptic state and floated off upon a flood of
harmony. Miss Moodle and her mits, self and
lemon kids, even the sleepless eye of Barker,
watching for an indiscretion, upon the strength
of which he might defensibly send somebody
to bed the next Saturday afternoon, all vanished
from before me, swallowed up in a mild
glory, which contained but two objects,&mdash;an
angel with low neck and short sleeves, and
an insensate hippopotamus of a piano, which
did not wriggle all over with ecstasy when her
white fingers tickled him.</p>

<p>At such moments I would gladly have gone
down on all fours, and had a key-board mortised
into my side at any expense of personal
torture, if Miss Tucker could only have played
a piece on me, and herself been conscious of
the chords she was awakening inside my jacket.
I loved her to that degree that my hair never
seemed brushed enough when I beheld her;
and I quite spoiled the shape of my best boots
through an elevation of the instep, caused by
putting a rolled-up pair of stockings inside each
heel, to approximate the manly stature, at our
bi-monthly meetings. Even her friend, Miss
Crickey, a mealy-faced little girl, with saffron
hair, who had been pushed by Miss Moodle so
far into the higher branches, that she had a
look of being perpetually frightened to death
with the expectation of hearing them crack and
let her down from a great height,&mdash;seemed
beautiful to me from the mere fact of daily
breathing the same air with such an angel,
sharing her liquorice-stick, and borrowing her
sweet little thimble.</p>

<p>I had other reasons for prejudice in Miss
Crickey's favor. She was the only person to
whom I could talk freely regarding the depth
of my passion for Miss Tucker. Not even to the
object of that tremendous feeling could I utter
a syllable which seemed in any way adequate.
With an overpowering consciousness how ridiculous
it was, and not only so, but how far from
original, I could give her papers of lemon Jackson-balls,
hinting simultaneously that, though
plump as her cheeks, they were not half so
sweet; and through a figure, whose correct name
I have since learned to be periphrasis, I could
suggest how much my soul yearned to expire
on her ruby lips, by asking if she had ever played
doorkeeper; regretting that the atmosphere of
refinement and intellectuality did not admit of
that healthful recreation at Moodle's, and
begging her to guess whom I would call out if
I were doorkeeper myself. When she opened
her blue eyes innocently, and said, &quot;Miss
Crickey?&quot; the intimation was rejected with a
melancholy dissatisfaction, which would have
been disdain but for the character of my feelings
to its source. And when, on my pressing
her for the name of the favored mortal whom
she would call out if she were doorkeeper, she
slyly dropped her eyes and asked if Briggs
sounded any thing like it, I savagely refused to
consider the proposition at all, and for the rest
of the evening ate sandwiches to that degree I
wonder my life was not despaired of, and fled
for relief to the lemony bowl. The result of
this mad vortex having been colic and calomel,
after my return to Barker's on that evening, I
foreswore such dangerous excesses at the next
bi-monthly; but putting a larger pair of stockings
in each boot-heel, to impress Miss Tucker
with a sense of what she had lost, I devoted
myself during the earlier part of the evening to
a growing young woman, of the name of Wagstaff,
considerably older than myself and runing
straight up and down from whatever side
one might contemplate her. Her conversation
was not entertaining, unless from the Chinese
point of view, which, I understand, distinctly
favors monosyllables, and she giggled at me so
persistently that I feared Miss Tucker would
think I must be making myself ridiculous; but,
on her being sent to the piano, I stood and
turned over her music with a consciousness
that if I ever looked impressive it was then.
All this I did in the effort to seem gay, although
my heart was breaking. I had no comfort
on earth save the thought that I had been
brutal to Briggs, and that he sat in an obscure
corner of the room among some little girls in
Long Division, hiding, behind an assistant
teacher's skirts, the whitey-brown toe which
my blacking-brush refused to refresh, while I
bore my grief upon a pair of new boots plentifully
provided with squeak-leather. When Miss
Tucker slipped a little piece of paper into my
hand, as I made a hollow show of passing her
the sandwiches, I came very near dropping the
plate; and when I had a chance to open it unobserved,
and read the words, &quot;Are you mad
with me?&quot; I could not occupy my cold and
dreary pinnacle a moment longer, but sought
an early opportunity of squeezing her hand two
seats behind the voluminous asylum of Briggs's
toes, and whispering, slightly confused by intensity
of feeling, that if I had done any thing
I was sorry for, I was willing to be forgiven.
From that moment I was Miss Tucker's slave.
Oh, woman, woman! The string on which you
play us is as long as life; it ties your baby-bib;
it laces your queenly bodice; and on its slenderest
tag we dangle everywhere!&mdash;<i>Little

<h2><a name="SELECTIONS_FROM_A_BRACE_OF_BOYS" id="SELECTIONS_FROM_A_BRACE_OF_BOYS"></a>SELECTIONS FROM A BRACE OF BOYS.</h2>

<p>I am a bachelor uncle. That, as a mere fact,
might happen to anybody; but I am a bachelor
uncle by internal fitness. I am one essentially,
just as I am an individual of the Caucasian division
of the human race; and if, through untoward
circumstances,&mdash;which Heaven forbid,&mdash;I
should lose my present position, I shouldn't
be surprised if you saw me out in the <i>Herald</i>
under &quot;Situations Wanted&mdash;Males.&quot; Thanks
to a marrying tendency in the rest of my family,
I have now little need to advertise, all the
business being thrown into my way which a
single member of my profession can attend
to....</p>

<p>I meander, like a desultory, placid river of an
old bachelor as I am, through the flowery mead
of several nurseries. I am detained by all the
little roots that run down into me to drink
happiness, but I linger longest among the children
of my sister Lu.</p>

<p>Lu married Mr. Lovegrove. He is a merchant,
retired with a fortune amassed by the
old-fashioned, slow processes of trade, and regards
the mercantile life of the present day
only as so much greed and gambling Christianly
baptized.... Lu is my favorite sister;
Lovegrove an unusually good article of brother-in-law
and I cannot say that any of my nieces
and nephews interest me more than their two
children, Daniel and Billy, who are more unlike
than words can paint them. They are far apart
in point of years; Daniel is twenty-two, Billy
eleven. I was reminded of this fact the other
day by Billy, as he stood between my legs,
scowling at his book of sums.</p>

<p>&quot;'A boy has eighty-five turnips, and gives
his sister thirty,'&mdash;pretty present for a girl,
isn't it?&quot; said Billy, with an air of supreme
contempt. &quot;Could <i>you</i> stand such stuff,&mdash;say?&quot;</p>

<p>I put on my instructive face and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, my dear Billy, you know that arithmetic
is necessary to you if you mean to be an
industrious man and succeed in business. Suppose
your parents were to lose all their property,
what would become of them without a
little son who could make money and keep
accounts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Billy, with surprise. &quot;Hasn't
father got enough stamps to see him through?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has now, I hope; but people don't
always keep them. Suppose they should go
by some accident, when your father was too
old to make any more stamps for himself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't thought of brother Daniel&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>True; for nobody ever had, in connection
with the active employments of life.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Billy,&quot; I replied, &quot;I forgot him; but
then, you know, Daniel is more of a student
than a business man, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O Uncle Teddy! you don't think I mean
he'd support them? I meant I'd have to
take care of father and mother, and him too,
when they'd all got to be old people together.
Just think! I'm eleven, and he's twenty-two
so he is just twice as old as I am. How
old are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forty, Billy, last August.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you aren't so awful old, and when I
get to be as old as you, Daniel will be eighty.
Seth Kendall's grandfather isn't more than
that, and he has to be fed with a spoon, and a
nurse puts him to bed, and wheels him round
in a chair like a baby. That takes the stamps,
I bet! Well, I'll tell you how I'll keep my
accounts; I'll have a stick, like Robinson Crusoe,
and every time I make a toadskin I'll
gouge a piece out of one side of the stick, and
every time I spend one I'll gouge a piece out
of the other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spend a <i>what</i>?&quot; said the gentle and astonished
voice of my sister Lu, who, unperceived,
had slipped into the room.</p>

<p>&quot;A toadskin, ma,&quot; replied Billy, shutting up
Colburn with a farewell glance of contempt.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear, dear! Where does the boy learn such
horrid words?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, ma, don't you know what a toadskin
is? Here's one,&quot; said Billy, drawing a dingy
five-cent stamp from his pocket. &quot;And don't I
wish I had lots of 'em!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; sighed his mother, &quot;to think I should
have a child so addicted to slang! How I wish
he were like Daniel!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, mother,&quot; replied Billy, &quot;if you wanted
two boys just alike you'd oughter had twins.
There ain't any use of my trying to be like
Daniel now, when he's got eleven years the
start. Whoop! There's a dog-fight; hear
'em! It's Joe Casey's dog,&mdash;I know his
bark!&quot;</p>

<p>With these words my nephew snatched his
Glengarry bonnet from the table and bolted
downstairs to see the fun.</p>

<p>&quot;What will become of him?&quot; said Lu, hopelessly;
&quot;he has no taste for any thing but rough
play; and then such language as he uses! Why
<i>isn't</i> he like Daniel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose because his Maker never repeats
himself. Even twins often possess strongly
marked individualities. Don't you think it
would be a good plan to learn Billy better before
you try to teach him? If you do, you'll
make something as good of him as Daniel
though it will be rather different from that
model.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, Ned, that you never did like
Daniel as well as you do Billy. But we all
know the proverb about old maid's daughters
and old bachelor's sons. I wish you had Billy
for a month,&mdash;then you'd see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not sure that I'd do any better than
you. I might err as much in other directions
But I'd try to start right by acknowledging
that he was a new problem, not to be worked
without finding out the value of X in his particular
instance. The formula which solves one
boy will no more solve the next one than the
rule-of-three will solve a question in calculus,&mdash;or,
to rise into your sphere, than the receipt for
one-two-three-four cake will conduct you to a
successful issue through plum-pudding.&quot;</p>

<p>I excel in metaphysical discussion, and was
about giving further elaboration to my favorite
idea, when the door burst open. Master Billy
came tumbling in with a torn jacket, a bloody
nose, the trace of a few tears in his eyes, and
the mangiest of cur dogs in his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my! my!! my!!!&quot; exclaimed his
mother.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you get scared, ma!&quot; cried Billy,
smiling a stern smile of triumph; &quot;I smashed
the nose off him! He wont sass me again for
nothing <i>this</i> while! Uncle Teddy, d'ye know
it wasn't a dog-fight, after all? There was that
nasty, good-for-nothing Joe Casey, 'n Patsy
Grogan, and a lot of bad boys from Mackerelville;
and they'd caught this poor little ki-oodle
and tied a tin pot to his tail, and were
trying to set Joe's dog on him, though he's ten
times littler.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You naughty, naughty boy! How did you
suppose your mother'd feel to see you playing
with those ragamuffins?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I <i>played</i> 'em! I polished 'em,&mdash;that's
the play I did! Says I, 'Put down that poor
little pup; ain't you ashamed of yourself, Patsy
Grogan?' 'I guess you don't know who I am,'
says he. That's the way they always say,
Uncle Teddy, to make a fellow think they're
some awful great fighters. So says I again,
'Well, you put down that dog, or I'll show you
who I am'; and when he held on, I let him have.
Then he dropped the pup, and as I stooped to
pick it up he gave me one on the bugle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Bugle</i>! Oh! oh! oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The rest pitched in to help him; but I
grabbed the pup, and while I was trying to
give as good as I got,&mdash;only a fellow can't do
it well with only one hand, Uncle Teddy,&mdash;up
came a policeman, and the whole crowd ran
away. So I got the dog safe, and here he is!&quot;</p>

<p>With that Billy set down his &quot;ki-oodle,&quot; bid
farewell to every fear, and wiped his bleeding
nose. The unhappy beast slunk back between
the legs of his preserver and followed him out
of the room, as Lu, with an expression of
maternal despair, bore him away for the correction
of his dilapidated raiment and depraved
associations. I felt such sincere pride in this
young Mazzini of the dog-nation, that I was
vexed at Lu for bestowing on him reproof
instead of congratulation; but she was not the
only conservative who fails to see a good cause
and a heroic heart under a bloody nose and
torn jacket. I resolved that if Billy was punished
he should have his recompense before
long in an extra holiday at Barnum's or the
Hippotheatron.</p>

<p>You already have some idea of my other
nephew, if you have noticed that none of us,
not even that habitual disrespecter of dignities,
Billy, ever called him Dan. It would have
seemed as incongruous as to call Billy William.
He was one of those youths who never gave
their parents a moment's uneasiness; who
never had to have their wills broken, and
never forget to put on their rubbers or take an
umbrella. In boyhood he was intended for a
missionary. Had it been possible for him to
go to Greenland's icy mountains without catching
cold, or India's coral strand, without getting
bilious, his parents would have carried out their
pleasing dream of contributing him to the
world's evangelization. Lu and Mr. Lovegrove
had no doubt that he would have been greatly
blessed if he could have stood it....</p>

<p>Both she and his father always encouraged old
manners in him. I think they took such pride
in raising a peculiarly pale boy as a gardener
does in getting a nice blanch on his celery, and
so long as he was not absolutely sick, the graver
he was the better. He was a sensitive plant,
a violet by a mossy stone, and all that sort of
thing....</p>

<p>At the time I introduce Billy, both Lu and
her husband were much changed. They had
gained a great deal in width of view and liberality
of judgment. They read Dickens, and
Thackeray with avidity; went now and then to
the opera; proposed to let Billy take a quarter
at Dodworth's; had statues in their parlor
without any thought of shame at their lack
of petticoats, and did multitudes of things
which, in their early married life, they would
have considered shocking.... They would
greatly have liked to see Daniel shine in society.
Of his erudition they were proud even
to worship. The young man never had any
business, and his father never seemed to think
of giving him any, knowing, as Billy would
say, that he had stamps enough to &quot;see him
through.&quot; If Daniel liked, his father would
have endowed a professorship in some college
and given him the chair; but that would have
taken him away from his own room and the
family physician.</p>

<p>Daniel knew how much his parents wished
him to make a figure in the world, and only
blamed himself for his failure, magnanimously
forgetting that they had crushed out the faculties
which enable a man to mint the small
change of every-day society, in the exclusive
cultivation of such as fit him for smelting its
ponderous ingots. With that merciful blindness
which alone prevents all our lives from
becoming a horror of nerveless self-reproach,
his parents were equally unaware of their share
in the harm done him, when they ascribed to a
delicate organization the fact that, at an age
when love runs riot in all healthy blood, he
could not see a Balmoral without his cheeks
rivalling the most vivid stripe in it. They flattered
themselves that he would outgrow his
bashfulness; but Daniel had no such hope, and
frequently confided in me that he thought he
should never marry at all.</p>

<p>About two hours after Billy's disappearance
under his mother's convoy, the defender of the
oppressed returned to my room bearing the dog
under his arm. His cheeks shone with washing
like a pair of waxy spitzenbergs, and other indignities
had been offered him to the extent of
the brush and comb. He also had a whole
jacket on....</p>

<p>Billy and I also obtained permission to go
out together and be gone the entire afternoon.
We put Crab on a comfortable bed of rags in
an old shoe-box, and then strolled hand-in-hand
across that most delightful of New York
breathing-places&mdash;Stuyvesant Square.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Teddy,&quot; exclaimed Billy, with ardor,
&quot;I wish I could do something to show you how
much I think of you for being so good to me.
I don't know how. Would it make you happy
if I was to learn a hymn for you,&mdash;a smashing
big hymn&mdash;six verses, long metre, and no
grumbling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Billy; you make me happy enough
just by being a good boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Teddy!&quot; replied Billy, decidedly,
&quot;I'm afraid I can't do it. I've tried so often,
and I always make such an awful mess of
it.&quot; ...</p>

<p>We now got into a Broadway stage going
down, and being unable, on account of the
noise, to converse further upon those spiritual
conflicts of Billy's which so much interested
me, amused ourselves with looking out until
just as we reached the Astor House, when he
asked me where we were going.</p>

<p>&quot;Where do you guess?&quot; said I.</p>

<p>He cast a glance through the front window,
and his face became irradiated. Oh, there's
nothing like the simple, cheap luxury of pleasing
a child, to create sunshine enough for the
chasing away of the bluest adult devils.</p>

<p>&quot;We're going to Barnum's!&quot; said Billy, involuntarily
clapping his hands.</p>

<p>So we were; and, much as stuck-up people
pretend to look down on the place, I frequently
am. Not only so, but I always see that class
largely represented there when I do go. To be
sure, they always make believe that they only
come to amuse the children, or because they've
country cousins visiting them, and never fail to
refer to the vulgar set one finds there, and the
fact of the animals smelling like any thing but
Jockey Club; yet I notice that after they've
been in the hall three minutes they're as much
interested as any of the people they come to
pooh-pooh, and only put on the high-bred air
when they fancy some of their own class are
looking at them. I boldly acknowledge that I
go because I like it. I am especially happy, to
be sure, if I have a child along to go into
ecstasies, and give me a chance, by asking
questions, for the exhibition of that fund of information
which is said to be one of my chief
charms in the social circle, and on several occasions
has led that portion of the public immediately
about the Happy Family into the
erroneous impression that I was Mr. Barnum,
explaining his five hundred thousand curiosities.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, we found several
visitors of the better class in the room devoted
to the aquarium. Among these was a young
lady, apparently about nineteen, in a tight-fitting
basque of black velvet, which showed her
elegant figure to fine advantage, a skirt of garnet
silk, looped up over a pretty Balmoral, and the
daintiest imaginable pair of kid walking-boots.
Her height was a trifle over the medium; her
eyes a soft, expressive brown, shaded by
masses of hair which exactly matched their
color, and, at that rat-and-miceless day fell in
such graceful abandon as to show at once that
nature was the only maid who crimped their
waves into them. Her complexion was rosy
with health and sympathetic enjoyment; her
mouth was faultless, her nose sensitive, her
manners full of refinement, and her voice
musical as a wood-robin's, when she spoke to
the little boy of six at her side, to whom she
was revealing the palace of the great show-king.
Billy and I were flattening our noses against
the abode of the balloon-fish, and determining
whether he looked most like a horse-chestnut
burr or a ripe cucumber, when his eyes and my
own simultaneously fell on the child and lady,
In a moment, to Billy, the balloon-fish was
as though he had not been.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a pretty little boy!&quot; said I. And
then I asked Billy one of those senseless routine
questions which must make children look at us,
regarding the scope of our intellects very much
as we look at Bushmen.</p>

<p>&quot;How would you like to play with him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Him!&quot; replied Billy, scornfully, &quot;that's his
first pair of boots; see him pull up his little
breeches to show the red tops to 'em! But,
crackey! isn't <i>she</i> a smasher!&quot;</p>

<p>After that we visited the wax figures and the
sleepy snakes, the learned seal and the glass-blowers.
Whenever we passed from one room
into another, Billy could be caught looking
anxiously to see if the pretty girl and child
were coming, too.</p>

<p>Time fails me to describe how Billy was lost
in astonishment at the Lightning Calculator,&mdash;wanted
me to beg the secret of that prodigy for
him to do his sums by,&mdash;finally thought he had
discovered it, and resolved to keep his arm
whirling all the time he studied his arithmetic
lesson the next morning. Equally inadequate
is it to relate in full how he became so confused
among the wax-works that he pinched the
solemnest showman's legs to see if he was real,
and perplexed the beautiful Circassian to the
verge of idiocy by telling her he had read all
about the way they sold girls like her in his
geography.</p>

<p>We had reached the stairs to that subterranean
chamber in which the Behemoth of Holy
Writ was wallowing about without a thought of
the dignity which one expects from a canonical
character. Billy had always languished upon
his memories of this diverting beast, and I
stood ready to see him plunge headlong the
moment that he read the sign-board at the head
of the stairs. When he paused and hesitated
there, not seeming at all anxious to go down
till he saw the pretty girl and the child following
after,&mdash;a sudden intuition flashed across me.
Could it be possible that Billy was caught in
that vortex which whirled me down at ten
years,&mdash;a little boy's first love?</p>

<p>We were lingering about the elliptical basin,
and catching occasional glimpses between bubbles
of a vivified hair trunk of monstrous compass,
whose knobby lid opened at one end and
showed a red morocco lining, when the pretty
girl, in leaning over to point out the rising
monster, dropped into the water one of her
little gloves, and the swash made by the hippopotamus
drifted it close under Billy's hand.
Either in play or as a mere coincidence the animal
followed it. The other children about the
tank screamed and started back as he bumped
his nose against the side; but Billy manfully
bent down and grabbed the glove not an inch
from one of his big tusks, then marched around
the tank and presented it to the lady with a
chivalry of manner in one of his years quite
surprising.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a real nice boy,&mdash;you said so, didn't
you, Lottie?&mdash;and I wish he'd come and play
with me,&quot; said the little fellow by the young
lady's side, as Billy turned away, gracefully
thanked, to come back to me with his cheeks
roseate with blushes.</p>

<p>As he heard this, Billy idled along the edge of
the tank for a moment, then faced about and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;P'raps I will some day,&mdash;where do you live?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I live on East Seventeenth street with
papa,&mdash;and Lottie stays there, too, now,&mdash;she's
my cousin. Where d' you live?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I live close by,&mdash;right on that big
green square, where I guess the nurse takes
you once in a while,&quot; said Billy, patronizingly.
Then, looking up pluckily at the young lady,
he added, &quot;I never saw you out there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; Jimmy's papa has only been in his new
house a little while, and I've just come to visit
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say, will you come and play with me some
time?&quot; chimed in the inextinguishable Jimmy.
&quot;I've got a cooking-stove,&mdash;for real fire,&mdash;and
blocks and a ball with a string.&quot;</p>

<p>Billy, who belonged to a club for the practice
of the great American game, and was what A.
Ward would call the most superior battist
among the I.G.B.B.C., or &quot;Infant Giants,&quot;
smiled from that altitude upon Jimmy, but
promised to go and play with him the next
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Late that evening, after we had got home
and dined, as I sat in my room over Pickwick
with a sedative cigar, a gentle knock at the
door told of Daniel. I called &quot;Come in!&quot; and
entering with a slow, dejected air, he sat down
by my fire. For ten minutes he remained silent,
though occasionally looking up as if
about to speak, then dropping his head again
to ponder on the coals. Finally I laid down
Dickens, and spoke myself.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't seem well to-night, Daniel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't feel very well, uncle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter, my boy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh-ah, I don't know. That is, I wish I knew
how to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>I studied him for a few moments with kindly
curiosity, then answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I can save you the trouble by
cross-examining it out of you. Let's try the
method of elimination. I know that you're
not harassed by any economical considerations,
for you've all the money you want; and I
know that ambition doesn't trouble you, for
your tastes are scholarly. This narrows down
the investigation of your symptoms&mdash;listlessness,
general dejection, and all&mdash;to three
causes,&mdash;dyspepsia, religious conflicts, love.
Now, is your digestion awry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir; good as usual. I'm not melanancholy
on religion, and&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't tell me you're in love?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I suppose that's about it, Uncle
Teddy.&quot;</p>

<p>I took a long breath to recover from my astonishment
at this unimaginable revelation,
then said:</p>

<p>&quot;Is your feeling returned?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really don't know, uncle; I don't believe
it is. I don't see how it can be. I never did
any thing to make her love me. What is there
in me to love? I've borne nothing for her,&mdash;that
is, nothing that could do her any good,&mdash;though
I've endured on her account, I may
say, anguish. So, look at it any way you
please, I neither am, do, nor suffer any thing
that can get a woman's love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you man of learning! Even in love
you tote your grammar along with you, and
arrange a divine passion under the active, passive,
and neuter!&quot;</p>

<p>Daniel smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&quot;You've no idea, Uncle Teddy, that you are
twitting on facts; but you hit the truth there;
indeed you do. If she were a Greek or Latin
woman, I could talk Anacreon or Horace to
her. If women only understood the philosophy
of the flowers as well as they do the poetry&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God they don't, Daniel!&quot; sighed I,
devoutly.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind,&mdash;in that case I could entrance
her for hours, talking about the grounds of difference
between Linn&aelig;us and Jussieu. Women
like the star business, they say,&mdash;and I could tell
her where all the constellations are; but sure
as I tried to get off any sentiment about them,
I'd break down and make myself ridiculous.
But what earthly chance would the greatest
philosopher that ever lived have with the
woman he loved, if he depended for her favor
on his ability to analyze her bouquet or
tell her when she might look out for the next
occultation of Orion? I can't talk bread-and-butter
talk. I can't do any thing that makes a
man even tolerable to a woman!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you don't mean that nothing but
bread-and-butter talk is tolerable to a woman!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; but it's necessary to some extent,&mdash;at
any rate the ability is,&mdash;in order to succeed
in society; and it's in society men first meet
and strike women. And oh, Uncle Teddy!
I'm such a fish out of water in society!&mdash;such
a dreadful floundering fish! When I see her
dancing gracefully as a swan swims, and feel
that fellows, like little Jack Mankyn, who 'don't
know twelve times,' can dance to her perfect
admiration; when I see that she likes ease of
manners,&mdash;and all sorts of men without an idea
in their heads have that,&mdash;while I turn all colors
when I speak to her, and am clumsy, and
abrupt, and abstracted, and bad at repartee,&mdash;Uncle
Teddy! sometimes (though it seems so
ungrateful to father and mother, who have
spent such pains for me)&mdash;sometimes, do you
know, it seems to me as if I'd exchange all
I've ever learned for the power to make a good
appearance before her!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daniel, my boy, it's too much a matter of
reflection with you! A woman is not to be
taken by laying plans. If you love the lady
(whose name I don't ask you, because I know
you'll tell me as soon as you think best), you
must seek her companionship until you're well
enough acquainted with her to have her regard
you as something different from the men whom
she meets merely in society, and judge your
qualities by another standard than that she applies
to them. If she's a sensible girl (and God
forbid you should marry her otherwise), she
knows that people can't always be dancing, or
holding fans, or running after orange-ice. If
she's a girl capable of appreciating your best
points (and woe to you if you marry a girl who
can't!), she'll find them out upon closer intimacy,
and, once found, they'll a hundred times
outweigh all brilliant advantages kept in the
show-case of fellows who have nothing on the
shelves. When this comes about, you will pop
the question unconsciously, and, to adapt Milton,
she'll drop into your lap 'gathered&mdash;not
harshly plucked.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that's sensible, Uncle Teddy, and
I'll try. Let me tell you the sacredest of secrets,&mdash;regularly
every day of my life I send
her a little poem fastened round the prettiest
bouquet I can get at Hanft's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does she know who sends them?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She can't have any idea. The German boy
that takes them knows not a word of English
except her name and address. You'll forgive
me, uncle, for not mentioning her name yet?
You see she may despise or hate me some day
when she knows who it is that has paid her
these attentions; and then I'd like to be able
to feel that at least I've never hurt her by any
absurd connection with myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive you? Nonsense! The feeling
does your heart infinite credit, though a little
counsel with your head would show you that
your only absurdity is self-depreciation.&quot;</p>

<p>Daniel bid me good-night. As I put out my
cigar and went to bed, my mind reverted to the
dauntless little Hotspur who had spent the afternoon
with me and reversed his mother's
wish, thinking,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, if Daniel were more like Billy!&quot;</p>

<p>It was always Billy's habit to come and sit
with me while I smoked my after-breakfast
cigar, but the next morning did not see him
enter my room till St. George's hands pointed
to a quarter of nine.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Billy Boy Blue, come blow your horn;
what haystack have you been under till this
time of day? We sha'n't have a minute to
look over our spelling together, and I know a
boy who's going in for promotion next week.
Have you had your breakfast, and taken care
of Crab?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir; but I didn't feel like getting up
this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sick?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No-o-o&mdash;it isn't that; but you'll laugh at
me if I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed I won't, Billy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot;&mdash;his voice dropped to a whisper, and
he stole close to my side,&mdash;&quot;I had such a nice
dream about <i>her</i> just the last thing before the
bell rang; and when I woke up I felt so queer,&mdash;so
kinder good and kinder bad,&mdash;and I
wanted to see her so much, that if I hadn't
been a big boy I believe I should have blubbered.
I tried ever so much to go to sleep and
see her again; but the more I tried the more I
couldn't. After all, I had to get up without it,
though I didn't want any breakfast, and only ate
two buckwheat cakes, when I always eat six, you
know, Uncle Teddy. Can you keep a secret?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear, so you couldn't get it out of
me if you were to shake me upside-down like a
savings-bank.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ain't you mean! That was when I was
small I did that. I'll tell you the secret,
though,&mdash;that girl and I are going to get married.
I mean to ask her the first chance I get.
Oh, isn't she a smasher!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Billy, sha'n't you wait a little
while to see if you always like her as well as
you do now? Then, too, you'll be older.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm old enough, Uncle Teddy, and I love
her dearly! I'm as old as the kings of France
used to be when they got married,&mdash;I read it in
Abbott's histories. But there's the clock
striking nine! I must run or I shall get a tardy
mark, and, perhaps, she'll want to see my certificate
sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, he kissed me on the cheek and set
off for school as fast as his legs could carry him.
O Love, omnivorous Love, that sparest neither
the dotard leaning on his staff nor the boy with
pantaloons buttoning on his jacket,&mdash;omnipotent
Love, that, after parents and teachers
have failed, in one instant can make Billy try
to become a good boy!</p>

<p>With both of my nephews hopelessly enamored,
and myself the confidant of both, I
had my hands full. Daniel was generally dejected
and distrustful; Billy buoyant and jolly.
Daniel found it impossible to overcome his
bashfulness; was spontaneous only in sonnets,
brilliant only in bouquets. Billy was always
coming to me with pleasant news, told in his
slangy New-York boy vernacular. One day he
would exclaim,&mdash;&quot;Oh, I'm getting on prime!
I got such a smile off her this morning as I went
by the window!&quot; Another day he wanted
counsel how to get a valentine to her,&mdash;because
it was too big to shove in a lamp-post, and she
might catch him if he left it on the steps, rang
the bell, and ran away. Daniel wrote his own
valentine; but, despite its originality, that
document gave him no such comfort as Billy
got from twenty-five cents' worth of embossed
paper, pink cupids, and doggerel. Finally,
Billy announced to me that he had been to
play with Jimmy, and got introduced to his
girl.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Lu gave what they call &quot;a
little company,&quot;&mdash;not a party, but a reunion of
forty or fifty people with whom the family were
well acquainted, several of them living in our immediate
neighborhood. There was a goodly proportion
of young folk, and there was to be dancing
but the music was limited to a single piano
played by the German exile usual on such occasions,
and the refreshments did not rise to the
splendor of a costly supper. This kind of compromise
with fashionable gayety was wisely
deemed by Lu the best method of introducing
Daniel to the <i>beau monde</i>,&mdash;a push given the
timid eaglet by the maternal bird, with a soft
tree-top between him and the vast expanse of
society. How simple was the entertainment
may be inferred from the fact that Lu felt
somewhat discomposed when she got a note
from one of her guests asking leave to bring
along her niece, who was making her a few
weeks' visit. As a matter of course, however,
she returned answer to bring the young lady
and welcome.</p>

<p>Daniel's dressing-room having been given up
to the gentlemen I invited him to make his
toilet in mine, and, indeed, wanting him to
create a favorable impression, became his valet
<i>pro tem.</i>, tying his cravat, and teasing the
divinity-student look out of his side-hair. My
little dandy Billy came in for another share of
attention, and when I managed to button his
jacket for him so that it showed his shirt-studs
&quot;like a man's,&quot; Count d'Orsay could not have
felt a more pleasing sense of his sufficiency for
all the demands of the gay world.</p>

<p>When we reached the parlor we found Pa
and Ma Lovegrove already receiving. About
a score of guests had arrived. Most of them
were old married couples, which, after paying
their devoirs, fell in two like unriveted scissors,&mdash;the
gentlemen finding a new pivot in pa and
the ladies in ma, where they mildly opened and
shut upon such questions as severally concerned
them, such as &quot;the way gold closed,&quot; and &quot;how
the children were.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides the old married people there were
several old young men of distinctly hopeless
and unmarried aspect, who, having nothing in
common with the other class, nor sufficient
energy of character to band themselves for
mutual protection, hovered dejectedly about
the arch pillars, or appeared to be considering
whether, on the whole, it would not be feasible
and best to sit down on the centre-table.
These subsisted upon such crumbs of comfort
as Lu could get an occasional chance to throw
them by rapid sorties of conversation,&mdash;became
galvanically active the moment they were
punched up, and fell flat the moment the
punching was remitted. I did all I could for
them, but, having Daniel in tow, dared not sail
too near the edge of the Doldrums, lest he
should drop into sympathetic stagnation and
be taken preternaturally bashful, with his sails
all aback, just as I wanted to carry him gallantly
into action with some clipper-built
cruiser of a nice young lady. Finally, Lu bethought
herself of that last plank of drowning
conversationists, the photograph album. All
the dejected young men made for it at once,
some reaching it just as they were about to
sink for the last time, but all getting a grip on
it somehow, and staying there in company with
other people's babies whom they didn't know,
and celebrities whom they knew to death, until,
one by one, they either stranded upon a motherly
dowager by the Fire-place Shoals, or were
rescued from the Sofa Reef by some gallant
wrecker of a strong-minded young lady, with a
view to taking salvage out of them in the
German.</p>

<p>Besides these, were already arrived a dozen
nice little boys and girls, who had been invited
to make it pleasant for Billy. I had to remind
him of the fact that they were his guests, for,
in comparison with the queen of his affections,
they were in danger of being despised by him
as small fry.</p>

<p>The younger ladies and gentlemen,&mdash;those
who had fascinations to disport, or were in the
habit of disporting what they considered such,
were probably still at home consulting the
looking-glass until that oracle should announce
the auspicious moment for their setting forth.</p>

<p>Daniel was in conversation with a perfect
godsend of a girl, who understood Latin and
had begun Greek. Billy was taking a moment's
vacation from his boys and girls, busy with
&quot;Old Maid&quot; in the extension-room, and whispering
with his hand in mine, &quot;Oh, don't I wish
<i>she</i> were here!&quot; when a fresh invoice of ladies,
just unpacked from the dressing-room in all the
airy elegance of evening costume, floated
through the door. I heard Lu say,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Mrs. Rumbullion! Happy to see your
niece, too. How d'ye do, Miss Pilgrim?&quot;</p>

<p>At this last word Billy jumped as if he had
been shot, and the bevy of ladies opening about
sister Lu disclosed the charming face and figure
of the pretty girl we had met at Barnum's.</p>

<p>Billy's countenance rapidly changed from
astonishment to joy.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that splendid, Uncle Teddy? Just as
I was wishing it! It's just like the fairy books!&quot;
and, rushing up to the party of new-comers,
&quot;My dear Lottie!&quot; cried he, &quot;if I'd only
known you were coming I'd have gone after
you!&quot;</p>

<p>As he caught her by the hand I was pleased
to see her soft eyes brighten with gratification
at his enthusiasm, but my sister Lu looked on
naturally with astonishment in every feature.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Billy!&quot; said she, &quot;you ought not to
call a strange young lady' <i>Lottie</i>!' Miss Pilgrim,
you must excuse my wild boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you must excuse my mother, Lottie,&quot;
said Billy, affectionately patting Miss Pilgrim's
rose kid, &quot;for calling you a strange young lady.
You are not strange at all,&mdash;you're just as nice
a girl as there is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are no excuses necessary,&quot; said Miss
Pilgrim, with a bewitching little laugh. &quot;Billy
and I know each other intimately well, Mrs.
Lovegrove; and I confess that when I heard
the lady aunt had been invited to visit was his
mother, I felt all the more willing to infringe
etiquette this evening by coming where I had
no previous introduction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you care!&quot; said Billy, encouragingly.
&quot;I'll introduce you to every one of our family;
I know 'em if you don't.&quot;</p>

<p>At this moment I came up as Billy's reinforcement,
and fearing lest in his enthusiasm he
might forget the canon of society which introduces
a gentleman to a lady, not the lady to
him, I ventured to suggest it delicately by
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Billy, will you grant me the favor of a presentation
to Miss Pilgrim?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In a minute, Uncle Teddy,&quot; answered Billy,
considerably lowering his voice. &quot;The older
people first&quot;; and after this reproof I was left
to wait in the cold until he had gone through
the ceremony of introducing to the young lady
his father and his mother.</p>

<p>Billy, who had now assumed entire guardianship
of Miss Pilgrim, with an air of great dignity
intrusted her to my care and left us promenading
while he went in search of Daniel. I myself
looked in vain for that youth, whom I had
not seen since the entrance of the last comers.
Miss Pilgrim and I found a congenial common
ground in Billy, whom she spoke of as one of
the most delightfully original boys she had ever
met; in fact, altogether the most fascinating
young gentleman she had seen in New York
society. You may be sure it wasn't Billy's
left ear which burned when I made my
responses.</p>

<p>In five minutes he reappeared to announce,
in a tone of disappointment, that he could find
Daniel nowhere. He could see a light through
his keyhole, but the door was locked and he
could get no admittance. Just then Lu came
up to present a certain&mdash;no, an uncertain&mdash;young
man of the fleet stranded on parlor furniture
earlier in the evening. To Lu's great
astonishment Miss Pilgrim asked Billy's permission
to leave him. It was granted with all the
courtesy of a <i>preux chevalier</i>, on the condition,
readily assented to by the lady, that she should
dance one Lancers with him during the evening.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me!&quot; exclaimed Lu, after Billy had
gone back like a superior being to assist at the
childish amusement of his contemporaries,
&quot;Would any body ever suppose that was our
Billy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should, my dear sister,&quot; said I, with proud
satisfaction; &quot;but you remember I always was
just to Billy.&quot;</p>

<p>Left free, I went myself to hunt up Daniel.
I found his door locked and a light shining
through the keyhole, as Billy had stated. I
made no attempt to enter by knocking; but
going to my room and opening the window
next his, leaned out as far as I could, shoved
up his sash with my cane, and pushed aside
his curtain. Such an unusual method of communication
could not fail to bring him to the
window with a rush. When he saw me he
trembled like a guilty thing, his countenance
fell, and, no longer able to feign absence, he
unlocked his door and let me enter by the
normal mode.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Daniel Lovegrove, my nephew, what
does this mean? Are you sick?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Edward, I am not sick,&mdash;and this
means that I am a fool. Even a little boy like
Billy puts me to shame. I feel humbled to the
very dust. I wish I'd been a missionary and
got massacred by savages. Oh that I'd been
permitted to wear damp stockings in childhood,
or that my mother hadn't carried me through
the measles! If it weren't wrong to take my
life into my own hands, I'd open that window,
and&mdash;and&mdash;sit in a draught this very evening!
Oh, yes! I'm just that bitter! Oh, oh, oh!&quot;</p>

<p>And Daniel paced the floor with strides of
frenzy.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, my dear fellow, let's look at the
matter calmly a minute. What brought on
this sudden attack? You seemed doing well
enough the first ten minutes after we came
down. I was only out of your sight long
enough to speak to the Rumbullion party who
had just come in, and when I turned around you
were gone. Now you are in this fearful condition.
What is there in the Rumbullions to start
you off on such a bender of bashfulness as this
which I here behold?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rumbullion indeed!&quot; said Daniel. &quot;A
hundred Rumbullions could not make me feel
as I do. But <i>she</i> can shake me into a whirlwind
with her little finger; and <i>she</i> came with
the Rumbullions!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! D'you&mdash;Miss Pilgrim?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Pilgrim!&quot;</p>

<p>I labored with Daniel for ten minutes, using
every encouragement and argument I could
think of, and finally threatened him that I
would bring up the whole Rumbullion party,
Miss Pilgrim included, telling them that he had
invited them to look at his conchological
cabinet, unless he instantly shook the ice out
of his manner and accompanied me down stairs.
This dreadful menace had the desired effect.
He knew that I would not scruple to fulfil it;
and at the same time that it made him surrender,
it also provoked him with me to a degree
which gave his eyes and cheeks as fine a glow
as I could have wished for the purpose of a
favorable impression. The stimulus of wrath
was good for him, and there was little tremor
in his knees when he descended the stairs.
Well-a-day! So Daniel and Billy were rivals!</p>

<p>The latter gentleman met us at the foot of
the staircase.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there you are, Daniel!&quot; said he, cheerily.
&quot;I was just going to look after you and
Uncle Teddy. We've wanted you for the
dances. We've had the Lancers twice and
three round dances; and I danced the second
Lancers with Lottie. Now we're going to
play some games,&mdash;to amuse the children, you
know,&quot; he added, loftily, with the adult gesture
of pointing his thumb over his shoulder at the
extension-room. &quot;Lottie's going to play, too;
so will you and Daniel, won't you, uncle? Oh,
here comes Lottie now! This is my brother,
Miss Pilgrim,&mdash;let me introduce him to you.
I'm sure you'll like him. There's nothing he
don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Pilgrim had just come to the newel-post
of the staircase, and, when she looked into
Daniel's face, blushed like the red, red rose,
losing her self-possession perceptibly more than
Daniel.</p>

<p>The courage of weak warriors and timid gallants
mounts as the opposite party's falls, and
Daniel made out to say, in a firm tone, that it
was long since he had enjoyed the pleasure of
meeting Miss Pilgrim.</p>

<p>&quot;Not since Mrs. Cramcroud's last sociable, I
think,&quot; replied Miss Pilgrim, her cheeks and
eyes still playing the tell-tale.</p>

<p>&quot;Oho! so you don't want any introduction!&quot;
exclaimed Master Billy. &quot;I didn't know you
knew each other, Lottie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have met Mr. Lovegrove in society. Shall
we go and join the plays?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure we shall!&quot; cried Billy. &quot;You
needn't mind,&mdash;all the grown people are going
too.&quot;</p>

<p>On entering the parlor we found it as he
had said. The guests being almost all well
acquainted with each other, at the solicitation
of jolly little Mrs. Bloomingal, sister Lu had
consented to make a pleasant Christmas kind of
time of it, in which everybody was permitted
to be young again, and romp with the rompiest.
We played Blindman's-buff till we were tired of
that,&mdash;Daniel, to Lu's great delight, coming
out splendidly as Blindman, and evincing such
&quot;cheek&quot; in the style he hunted down and
caught the ladies, as satisfied me that nothing
but his eyesight stood in the way of his making
an audacious figure in the world. Then a pretty
little girl, Tilly Turtelle, who seemed quite a
premature flirt, proposed &quot;Door-keeper,&quot;&mdash;a
suggestion accepted with great <i>&eacute;clat</i> by all the
children, several grown people assenting.</p>

<p>To Billy&mdash;quite as much on account of his
shining prominence in the executive faculties
as of his character as host&mdash;was committed the
duty of counting out the first person to be sent
into the hall. There were so many of us that
&quot;Aina-maina-mona-mike&quot; would not go quite
round; but, with that promptness of expedience
which belongs to genius, Billy instantly added
on, &quot;Intery-mintery-cutery-corn,&quot; and the last
word of the cabalistic formula fell upon me&mdash;Edward
Balbus. I disappeared into the entry
amidst peals of happy laughter from both old
and young, calling, when the door opened again
to ask me whom I wanted, for the pretty lisping
flirt who had proposed the game. After
giving me a coquettish little chirrup of a kiss,
and telling me my beard scratched, she bade
me, on my return, send out to her &quot;Mithter
Billy Lovegrove.&quot; I obeyed her; my youngest
nephew retired; and after a couple of seconds,
during which Tilly undoubtedly got what
she proposed the game for, Billy being a great
favorite with the little girls, she came back,
pouting and blushing, to announce that he
wanted Miss Pilgrim. That young lady showed
no mock-modesty, but arose at once, and laughingly
went out to her youthful admirer, who, as
I afterward learned, embraced her ardently, and
told her he loved her better than any girl in the
world. As he turned to go back, she told him
that he might send to her one of her juvenile
cousins, Reginald Rumbullion. Now, whether
because on this youthful Rumbullion's account
Billy had suffered the pangs of that most terrible
passion, jealousy, or from his natural enjoyment
of playing practical jokes destructive
of all dignity in his elders, Billy marched into
the room, and, having shut the door behind him,
paralyzed the crowded parlor by an announcement
that Mr. Daniel Lovegrove was wanted.</p>

<p>I was standing at his side, and could feel him
tremble,&mdash;see him turn pale.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me!&quot; he whispered, in a choking
voice; &quot;can she mean me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course she does,&quot; said I. &quot;Who else?
Do you hesitate? Surely you can't refuse
such an invitation from a lady.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I suppose not,&quot; said he, mechanically.
And amidst much laughter from the disinterested,
while the faces of Mrs. Rumbullion and
his mother were spectacles of crimson astonishment,
he made his exit from the room. Never
in my life did I so much long for that instrument
described by Mr. Samuel Weller,&mdash;a pair
of patent double-million-magnifying microscopes
of hextry power, to see through a deal
door. Instead of this, I had to learn what happened
only by report.</p>

<p>Lottie Pilgrim was standing under the hall
burners with her elbow on the newel-post, looking
more vividly charming than he had ever
seen her before at Mrs. Cramcroud's sociable
or elsewhere. When startled by the apparition
of Mr. Daniel Lovegrove instead of the little
Rumbullion whom she was expecting,&mdash;she had
no time to exclaim or hide her mounting color,
none at all to explain to her own mind the mistake
that had occurred, before his arm was
clasped around her waist, and his lips so closely
pressed to hers, that through her soft thick
hair she could feel the throbbing of his temples.
As for Daniel, he seemed in a walking dream,
from which he waked to see Miss Pilgrim looking
into his eyes with utter though not incensed
stupefaction,&mdash;to stammer,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me! Do forgive me! I thought
you were in earnest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I was,&quot; she said, tremulously, as soon as
she could catch her voice, &quot;in sending for my
cousin Reginald.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear, what shall I do! Believe me, I
was told you wanted me,&mdash;let me go and explain
it to mother,&mdash;she'll tell the rest,&mdash;I
couldn't do it,&mdash;I'd die of mortification. Oh,
that wretched boy Billy!&quot;</p>

<p>On the principle already mentioned, his agitation
reassured her.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't try to explain it now,&mdash;it may get
Billy a scolding. Are there any but intimate
family friends here this evening?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;I believe&mdash;no&mdash;I'm sure,&quot; replied
Daniel, collecting his faculties.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I don't mind what they think. Perhaps
they'll suppose we've known each other
long; but we'll arrange it by-and-by. They'll
think the more of it the longer we stay out
here,&mdash;hear them laugh! I must run back now.
I'll send you somebody.&quot;</p>

<p>A round of juvenile applause greeted her as
she hurried into the parlor, and a number of
grown people smiled quite musically. Her
quick woman-wit showed her how to retaliate
and divide the embarrassment of the occasion.
As she passed me she said in an undertone,&mdash;&quot;Answer
quick! Who's that fat lady on the
sofa, that laughs so loud?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Cromwell Craggs,&quot; said I, as quietly.</p>

<p>Miss Pilgrim made a satirically low courtesy,
and spoke in a modest but distinct voice,&mdash;&quot;I
really must be excused for asking. I'm
a stranger, you know; but is there such a lady
here as Mrs. Craggs,&mdash;Mrs. <i>Cromwell</i> Craggs?
For if so, the present doorkeeper would like to
see Mrs. Cromwell Craggs.&quot;</p>

<p>Then came the turn of the fat lady to be
laughed at; but out she had to go and get
kissed like the rest of us.</p>

<p>Before the close of the evening, Billy was
made as jealous as his parents and I were surprised
to see Daniel in close conversation with
Miss Pilgrim among the geraniums and fuschias
of the conservatory. &quot;A regular flirtation,&quot;
said Billy, somewhat indignantly. The conclusion
they arrived at was, that after all no
great harm had been done, and that the dear
little fellow ought not to be peached on for his
fun. If I had known at the time how easily
they forgave him, I should have suspected that
the offence Billy had led Daniel into committing
was not unlikely to be repeated on the
offender's own account; but so much as I could
see showed me that the ice was broken....</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p>At five o'clock in the morning of the tenth
of July, 1860, the front door of a certain
house on Anchor Street, in the ancient seaport
town of Rivermouth, might have been observed
to open with great caution. This door, as the
least imaginative reader may easily conjecture,
did not open itself. It was opened by Miss
Margaret Callaghan, who immediately closed it
softly behind her, paused for a few seconds
with an embarrassed air on the stone step, and
then, throwing a furtive glance up at the second-story
windows, passed hastily down the street
towards the river, keeping close to the fences
and garden walls on her left.</p>

<p>There was a ghost-like stealthiness to Miss
Margaret's movements, though there was nothing
whatever of the ghost about Miss Margaret
herself. She was a plump, short person, no
longer young, with coal-black hair growing low
on the forehead, and a round face that would
have been nearly meaningless if the features
had not been emphasized&mdash;italicized, so to speak&mdash;by
the small-pox. Moreover, the brilliancy
of her toilet would have rendered any ghostly
hypothesis untenable. Mrs. Solomon (we refer
to the dressiest Mrs. Solomon, which ever one
that was) in all her glory was not arrayed like
Miss Margaret on that eventful summer morning.
She wore a light-green, shot-silk frock, a
blazing red shawl, and a yellow crape bonnet
profusely decorated with azure, orange, and
magenta artificial flowers. In her hand she
carried a white parasol. The newly risen sun,
ricocheting from the bosom of the river and
striking point-blank on the top-knot of Miss
Margaret's gorgeousness, made her an imposing
spectacle in the quiet street of that Puritan
village. But, in spite of the bravery of her apparel,
she stole guiltily along by garden walls
and fences until she reached a small, dingy
frame-house near the wharves, in the darkened
doorway of which she quenched her burning
splendor, if so bold a figure is permissible.</p>

<p>Three quarters of an hour passed. The sunshine
moved slowly up Anchor Street, fingered
noiselessly the well-kept brass knockers on
either side, and drained the heeltaps of dew
which had been left from the revels of the
fairies overnight in the cups of the morning-glories.
Not a soul was stirring yet in this
part of the town, though the Rivermouthians
are such early birds that not a worm may be
said to escape them. By and by one of the
brown Holland shades at one of the upper windows
of the Bilkins Mansion&mdash;the house from
which Miss Margaret had emerged&mdash;was drawn
up, and old Mr. Bilkins in spiral nightcap
looked out on the sunny street. Not a living
creature was to be seen, save the dissipated
family cat&mdash;a very Lovelace of a cat that was
not allowed a night-key&mdash;who was sitting on
the curbstone opposite, waiting for the hall
door to be opened. Three quarters of an hour,
we repeat, had passed, when Mrs. Margaret
O'Rourke, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Callaghan, issued from the small,
dingy house by the river, and regained the
door-step of the Bilkins mansion in the same
stealthy fashion in which she had left it.</p>

<p>Not to prolong a mystery that must already
oppress the reader, Mr. Bilkins's cook had,
after the manner of her kind, stolen out of the
premises before the family were up, and got
herself married&mdash;surreptitiously and artfully
married, as if matrimony were an indictable
offence.</p>

<p>And something of an offence it was in this
instance. In the first place Margaret Callaghan
had lived nearly twenty years with the Bilkins
family, and the old people&mdash;there were
no children now&mdash;had rewarded this long service
by taking Margaret into their affections.
It was a piece of subtle ingratitude for her
to marry without admitting the worthy couple
to her confidence. In the next place, Margaret
had married a man some eighteen years
younger than herself. That was the young
man's lookout, you say. We hold it was
Margaret that was to blame. What does a
young blade of twenty-two know? Not half
so much as he thinks he does. His exhaustless
ignorance at that age is a discovery which
is left for him to make in his prime.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under Bonnybells window panes,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wait till you come to Forty Year!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>In one sense Margaret's husband <i>had</i> come
to forty year&mdash;she was forty to a day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Margaret O'Rourke, with the baddish
cat following closely at her heels, entered the
Bilkins mansion, reached her chamber in the
attic without being intercepted, and there laid
aside her finery. Two or three times, while
arranging her more humble attire, she paused
to take a look at the marriage certificate,
which she had deposited between the leaves
of her Prayer-Book, and on each occasion
held that potent document upside down;
for Margaret's literary culture was of
the severest order, and excluded the art of
reading.</p>

<p>The breakfast was late that morning. As Mrs.
O'Rourke set the coffee-urn in front of Mrs. Bilkins
and flanked Mr. Bilkins with the broiled
mackerel and buttered toast, Mrs. O'Rourke's
conscience smote her. She afterwards declared
that when she saw the two sitting there so innocent-like,
not dreaming of the <i>comether</i> she
had put upon them, she secretly and unbeknownt
let a few tears fall into the cream-pitcher.
Whether or not it was this material
expression of Margaret's penitence that
spoiled the coffee does not admit of inquiry;
but the coffee was bad. In fact, the whole
breakfast was a comedy of errors.</p>

<p>It was a blessed relief to Margaret when the
meal was ended. She retired in a cold perspiration
to the penetralia of the kitchen, and it
was remarked by both Mr. and Mrs. Bilkins
that those short flights of vocalism&mdash;apropos
of the personal charms of one Kate Kearney,
who lived on the banks of Killarney&mdash;which
ordinarily issued from the direction of the
scullery we're unheard that forenoon.</p>

<p>The town clock was striking eleven, and the
antiquated time-piece on the staircase (which
never spoke but it dropped pearls and crystals,
like the fairy in the story) was lisping the hour,
when there came three tremendous knocks at
the street door. Mrs. Bilkins, who was dusting
the brass-mounted chronometer in the hall,
stood transfixed, with arm uplifted. The admirable
old lady had for years been carrying
on a guerilla warfare with itinerant venders of
furniture polish, and pain-killer, and crockery
cement and the like. The effrontery of the
triple knock convinced her the enemy was at
her gates&mdash;possibly that dissolute creature with
twenty-four sheets of note-paper and twenty-four
envelopes for fifteen cents.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bilkins swept across the hall, and
opened the door with a jerk. The suddenness
of the movement was apparently not anticipated
by the person outside, who, with one
arm stretched feebly towards the receding
knocker, tilted gently forward, and rested both
hands on the threshold in an attitude which
was probably common enough with our ancestors
of the Simian period, but could never have
been considered graceful. By an effort that
testified to the excellent condition of his
muscles, the person instantly righted himself,
and stood swaying unsteadily on his toes and
heels, and smiling rather vaguely on Mrs. Bilkins.</p>

<p>It was a slightly-built but well-knitted young
fellow, in the not unpicturesque garb of our
marine service. His woollen cap, pitched forward
at an acute angle with his nose, showed
the back part of a head thatched with short
yellow hair, which had broken into innumerable
curls of painful tightness. On his ruddy
cheeks a sparse, sandy beard was making a
timid <i>d&eacute;but</i>. Add to this a weak, good-natured
mouth, a pair of devil-may-care blue eyes, and
the fact that the man was very drunk, and you
have a pre-Raphaelite portrait&mdash;we may as well
say at once&mdash;of Mr. Larry O'Rourke of Mullingar,
County Westmeath, and late of the United
States sloop-of-war Santee.</p>

<p>The man was a total stranger to Mrs. Bilkins
but the instant she caught sight of the
double white anchors embroidered on the lapels
of his jacket, she unhesitatingly threw back
the door, which with great presence of mind
she had partly closed.</p>

<p>A drunken sailor standing on the step of the
Bilkins mansion was no novelty. The street,
as we have stated, led down to the wharves, and
sailors were constantly passing. The house
abutted directly on the street; the granite
door-step was almost flush with the sidewalk,
and the huge, old-fashioned brass knocker&mdash;seemingly
a brazen hand that had been cut off
at the wrist, and nailed against the oak as a
warning to malefactors&mdash;extended itself in a
kind of grim appeal to everybody. It seemed
to possess strange fascinations for all seafaring
folk; and when there was a man-of-war in port
the rat-tat-tat of that knocker would frequently
startle the quiet neighborhood long after midnight.
There appeared to be an occult understanding
between it and the blue-jackets.
Years ago there was a young Bilkins, one Pendexter
Bilkins&mdash;a sad losel, we fear&mdash;who ran
away to try his fortunes before the mast, and
fell overboard in a gale off Hatteras. &quot;Lost at
sea,&quot; says the chubby marble slab in the Old
South Burying-Ground, &quot;<i>&aelig;tat.</i> 18.&quot; Perhaps
that is why no blue-jacket, sober or drunk, was
ever repulsed from the door of the Bilkins
mansion.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Bilkins had her taste in the
matter, and preferred them sober. But as this
could not always be, she tempered her wind, so
to speak, to the shorn lamb. The flushed,
prematurely-old face that now looked up at
her moved the good lady's pity.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; she asked, kindly.</p>

<p>&quot;Me wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no wife for you here,&quot; said Mrs.
Bilkins, somewhat taken aback. &quot;His wife!&quot;
she thought; &quot;it's a mother the poor boy
stands in need of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me wife,&quot; repeated Mr. O'Rourke, &quot;for
betther or for worse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You had better go away,&quot; said Mrs. Bilkins,
bridling up, &quot;or it will be the worse for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To have and to howld,&quot; continued Mr.
O'Rourke, wandering retrospectively in the
mazes of the marriage service, &quot;to have and to
howld till death&mdash;bad luck to him!&mdash;takes one
or the ither of us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a blasphemous creature,&quot; said Mrs.
Bilkins, severely.</p>

<p>&quot;Thim's the words his riverince spake this
mornin', standin' foreninst us,&quot; explained Mr.
O'Rourke. &quot;I stood here, see, and me jew'l
stood there, and the howly chaplain beyont.&quot;</p>

<p>And Mr. O'Rourke with a wavering forefinger
drew a diagram of the interesting situation
on the door-step.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; returned Mrs. Bilkins, &quot;if you're a
married man, all I have to say is, there's a
pair of fools instead of one. You had better
be off; the person you want doesn't live
here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bedad, thin, but she does.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lives here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorra a place else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man's crazy,&quot; said Mrs. Bilkins to
herself.</p>

<p>While she thought him simply drunk, she
was not in the least afraid; but the idea that
she was conversing with a madman sent a chill
over her. She reached back her hand preparatory
to shutting the door, when Mr. O'Rourke,
with an agility that might have been expected
from his previous gymnastics, set one foot on
the threshold and frustrated the design.</p>

<p>&quot;I want me wife,&quot; he said sternly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Bilkins had gone uptown,
and there was no one in the house except
Margaret, whose pluck was not to be depended
on. The case was urgent. With the energy of
despair Mrs. Bilkins suddenly placed the toe of
her boot against Mr. O'Rourke's invading foot,
and pushed it away. The effect of this attack
was to cause Mr. O'Rourke to describe a complete
circle on one leg, and then sit down heavily
on the threshold. The lady retreated to the
hat-stand, and rested her hand mechanically on
the handle of a blue cotton umbrella. Mr.
O'Rourke partly turned his head and smiled
upon her with conscious superiority. At this
juncture a third actor appeared on the scene,
evidently a friend of Mr. O'Rourke, for he
addressed that gentleman as &quot;a spalpeen,&quot; and
told him to go home.</p>

<p>&quot;Divil an inch,&quot; replied the spalpeen; but he
got himself off the threshold, and resumed his
position on the step.</p>

<p>&quot;It's only Larry, mum,&quot; said the man,
touching his forelock politely; &quot;as dacent a
lad as ever lived, when he's not in liquor; an' I've
known him to be sober for days togither,&quot;
he added, reflectively. &quot;He don't mane a
ha'p'orth o' harum, but jist now he's not quite
in his right moind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should think not,&quot; said Mrs. Bilkins, turning
from the speaker to Mr. O'Rourke, who had
seated himself gravely on the scraper, and was
weeping. &quot;Hasn't the man any friends?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too many of 'em, mum, an' it's along wid
dhrinkin' toasts wid 'em that Larry got throwed.
The punch that spalpeen has dhrunk this day
would amaze ye. He give us the slip awhiles
ago, bad 'cess to him, an' come up here. Didn't
I tell ye, Larry, not to be afther ringin' at
the owle gintleman's knocker? Ain't ye got
no sinse at all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Misther Donnehugh,&quot; responded Mr.
O'Rourke with great dignity, &quot;ye're dhrunk
again.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Donnehugh, who had not taken more
than thirteen ladles of rum-punch, disdained to
reply directly.</p>

<p>&quot;He's a dacent lad enough&quot;&mdash;this to Mrs.
Bilkins&mdash;&quot;but his head is wake. Whin he's
had two sups o' whiskey he belaves he's dhrunk
a bar'l full. A gill o' wather out of a jimmy-john'd
fuddle him, mum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't there anybody to look after him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, mum, he's an orphan; his father and
mother live in the owld counthry, an' a fine
hale owld couple they are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hasn't he any family in the town?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, mum, he has a family; wasn't he
married this blessed mornin'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He said so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indade, thin, he was&mdash;the pore divil!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the&mdash;the person?&quot; inquired Mrs.
Bilkins.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it the wife, ye mane?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, the wife; where is she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, thin, mum,&quot; said Mr. Donnehugh,
&quot;it's yerself can answer that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I?&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Bilkins. &quot;Good heavens
this man's as crazy as the other!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Begorra, if anybody's crazy, it's Larry, for
it's Larry has married Margaret.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What Margaret?&quot; cried Mrs. Bilkins, with
a start.</p>

<p>&quot;Margaret Callaghan, sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Our</i> Margaret? Do you mean to say that
Our Margaret has married that&mdash;that good-for-nothing,
inebriated wretch!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a civil tongue the owld lady has, any
way,&quot; remarked Mr. O'Rourke, critically, from
the scraper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bilkins's voice during the latter part of
the colloquy had been pitched in a high key;
it rung through the hall and penetrated to the
kitchen, where Margaret was thoughtfully wiping
the breakfast things. She paused with a
half-dried saucer in her hand, and listened. In
a moment more she stood, with bloodless face
and limp figure, leaning against the banister,
behind Mrs. Bilkins.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it there ye are, me jew'l!&quot; cried Mr.
O'Rourke, discovering her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bilkins wheeled upon Margaret.</p>

<p>&quot;Margaret Callaghan, <i>is</i> that thing your husband?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ye&mdash;yes, mum,&quot; faltered Mrs. O'Rourke,
with a woful lack of spirit.</p>

<p>&quot;Then take it away!&quot; cried Mrs. Bilkins.</p>

<p>Margaret, with a slight flush on either cheek,
glided past Mrs. Bilkins, and the heavy oak door
closed with a bang, as the gates of Paradise
must have closed of old upon Adam and Eve.</p>

<p>&quot;Come!&quot; said Margaret, taking Mr. O'Rourke
by the hand; and the two wandered forth upon
their wedding journey down Anchor Street,
with all the world before them where to choose.
They chose to halt at the small, shabby tenement-house

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
